        <h2>Data Set Information</h2><p>- Law Frequency Power Data  <br><br>  ```<br>  The low_freq/ directory contains average power readings for both the<br>  two power mains and the individual circuits of the house (eventually,<br>  this will also contain plug loads for houses with individual plug<br>  monitors).  The data is logged at a frequency of about once a second<br>  for a mains and once every three seconds for the circuits.  The<br>  directory is organized as follows:<br>  <br>  redd/low_freq/<br>    house_{1..n}/          -- directories for each house<br>      labels.dat           -- device category labels for every channel<br>      channel_{1..k}.dat   -- time/wattage readings for each channel<br>  <br>  The main directory consists of several house_i directories, each of<br>  which contain all the power readings for a single house.  Each house<br>  subdirectory consists of a labels.dat and several channels_i.dat<br>  files.  The labels file contains channel numbers and a text label<br>  indicating the general category of device on this channel, for<br>  example:<br>  <br>  1 mains_1<br>  2 mains_2<br>  3 refrigerator<br>  4 lighting<br>  ...<br>  <br>  In cases where the circuit has different device types on it (for<br>  example, circuits that power multiple outlets), we have attempted to<br>  best categorize the main type of appliance on the circuit.<br>  <br>  Each channel_i.dat file contains UTC timestamps (as integers) and<br>  power readings (recording the apparent power of the circuit) for<br>  the channel:<br>  <br>  ...<br>  1306541834      102.964<br>  1306541835      103.125<br>  1306541836      104.001<br>  1306541837      102.994<br>  1306541838      102.361<br>  1306541839      102.589<br>  ...<br>  ```<br><br>- High Frequency Waveform Data    <br><br>  ```<br>  The high_freq/ directory contains AC waveform data for the power mains<br>  and a single phase of the voltage for the home.  In order to reduce<br>  the data to a manageable size, we have compressed these waveforms using<br>  lossy compression.  Briefly, the procedure is as follows:<br>  <br>  Because the voltage signal in most homes is approximately sinusoidal<br>  (unlike the current signals, which can vary substantially from a<br>  sinusoidal wave), we find zero-crossings of the voltage signal to<br>  isolate a single cycle of the AC power.  For the time spanned by this<br>  single cycle, we record both the current and voltage signals, and<br>  report this entire waveform.  However, because the waveforms remain<br>  approximately constant for long periods of time, we only report the<br>  current and voltage waveforms at "change points" in the signal (we<br>  identify change points using a method known as total variation<br>  regularization, but a full description of the approach is outside the<br>  scope of this readme).<br>  <br>  As before, the high_freq/ directory contains a subdirectory for each<br>  house, each of which contain current_1.dat, current_2.dat, and<br>  voltage.dat files.<br>  <br>  redd/low_freq/<br>    house_{1..n}/          -- directories for each house<br>      current_1.dat        -- current waveforms for first power mains<br>      current_2.dat        -- current waveforms for second power mains<br>      voltage.dat          -- voltage waveforms<br>  <br>  The data files are text files, where each line contains:<br>  <br>  1) A decimal UTC timestamp, in the same format as the timestamps for<br>  the low frequency data, but allowing for fractional parts<br>  2) A cycle count.  Although this is represented in the file as a<br>  double, it is in fact an integer that indicates for how many AC cycles<br>  this particular waveform remains.<br>  3) 275 decimal values, indicating the value of the waveform (in amps or<br>  volts), at equally-spaced portions of the cycle.<br>  <br>  Thus, an example file might be:<br>  <br>  1297340206.597013 135.000000 0.000000 3.623859 7.254136 10.949398 ...<br>  1297340208.844086 722.000000 0.000000 3.638527 7.249567 10.929027 ...<br>  ....<br>  <br>  Indicating that the waveform in the first line occurred first at<br>  timestamp 1297340206.597013 and lasted for 135 cycles.<br>  ```<br><br>- High Frequency Raw Data   <br><br>  ```<br>  Finally, the high_freq_raw/ directory contains raw current and voltage<br>  waveforms (unaligned and without compression), for a small number of<br>  sample points throughout the data.  This is main intended for those<br>  who wish to test different compression/filtering methods beyond what<br>  we do in the high_freq/ data.  Although for practicality we are not<br>  planning to broadly distribute raw data for the entire data set (this<br>  would consist of more than a terabyte of data), if other groups are<br>  able to develop substantially better compression/filtering techniques<br>  then we'd be happy to share the full data or run these proposed<br>  algorithms on the full uncompressed data set.<br>  <br>  The high_freq_raw/ directory is organized similar to the high_freq/<br>  directory, except that each current_1, current_2, and voltage files<br>  are instead themselves directories that contain raw binary data:<br>  <br>  high_freq_raw/<br>    house_{1..n}/          -- directories for each house<br>      current_1/           -- current waveforms for first power mains<br>        <timestamp>.bz2    -- compressed binary data<br>        ...<br>      current_2/           -- current waveforms for second power mains<br>      voltage/             -- voltage waveforms<br>  <br>  The current_1/, current_2/, and voltage/ directories contain a number<br>  of <timestamp>.bz2 files, for example 1303091049.bz2.  These are<br>  compressed binary files containing the raw current/voltage waveforms<br>  from the A/D as a sequence of 32-bit floating point numbers (stored in<br>  little-endian format).  Interspersed through the data are several<br>  'time' ASCII codes (hex: 0x74 0x69 0x6d 0x65).  This indicates that an<br>  8 byte time code is to follow, indicating the the time at the<br>  beginning of the sample.  The time is stored as two binary integers<br>  (again in little endian format): the first indicating the UTC<br>  timestamp in seconds, and the second indicating the fractional portion<br>  of the timestamp in nano-seconds.  The timestamps are taking using the<br>  Windows clock on the collecting machines, so are likely only accurate<br>  to the millisecond level or so.<br>  ```</p><h2>References</h2></table><a href='../index.html' class='btn btn-primary'>Back to Index</a></div></body></html>
