It was an outcome of a project initiated by Mohieddine Jelali during the writing of the book [Detection and Diagnosis of Stiction in Control Loops: State of the Art and Advanced Methods](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~bhuang/Stiction-Book.htm).<br><br>The data were provided by different international Colleagues (called Stiction Group) who have contributed to the book.<br>The Stiction Group has decided to publish the database to enable other researchers working on the field to test their own methods on industrial data.</p><h2>Attribute Information</h2><p>The data are stored in a structure cdata that contains substructures.<br><br>Each data set contains: comments; brief comments; type (0: self-regulating; 1: integrating); sampling period [s]; and the data: t (time) [s], SP (set point), PV (process variable), OP (controller output), and (only for some loops) Kc (proportional gain), Ti (integration time constant), en (normalised control error SP âˆ’ PV).<br><br>Example: PV for the chemical loop no. 19: pv = cdata.chemicals.loop19.PV.</p><h2>References</h2></table><a href='../index.html' class='btn btn-primary'>Back to Index</a></div></body></html>
