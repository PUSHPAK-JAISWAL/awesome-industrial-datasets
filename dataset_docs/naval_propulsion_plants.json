The propulsion system behaviour has been described with this parameters:\n\n- Ship speed (linear function of the lever position lp). \n- Compressor degradation coefficient kMc. \n- Turbine degradation coefficient kMt. \n\nso that each possible degradation state can be described by a combination of this triple (lp,kMt,kMc). \n\nThe range of decay of compressor and turbine has been sampled with an uniform grid of precision 0.001 so to have a good granularity of representation. In particular for the compressor decay state discretization the kMc coefficient has been investigated in the domain [1; 0.95], and the turbine coefficient in the domain [1; 0.975]. Ship speed has been investigated sampling the range of feasible speed from 3 knots to 27 knots with a granularity of representation equal to three knots. \n\nA series of measures (16 features) which indirectly represents of the state of the system subject to performance decay has been acquired and stored in the dataset over the parameter's space. \n\nShip speed has been investigated sampling the range of feasible speed from 3 knots to 27 knots with a granularity of representation equal to three knots.\n\nA series of measures (16 features) which indirectly represents of the state of the system subject to performance decay has been acquired and stored in the dataset over the parameter's space."
