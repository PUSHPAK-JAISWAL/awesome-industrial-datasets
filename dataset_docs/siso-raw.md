## Data Set Information  
Raw data collected in two and a half days from 52 control loops of an oil and gas company. For each loop, the controller output (OP), process variable (PV), setpoint (SP), and the valve stem position (MV) are recorded. The sampling time is not constant. The dataset is saved in HDF5 file.

## Attribute Information
- Time - timestamp in format 2017-10-06 12:00:00.964
- Values - recorded values
- Quality - quality based on OPC-UA standards
