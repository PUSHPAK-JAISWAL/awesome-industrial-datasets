# Superconductivty Data

**Summary:** Two files contain data on 21263 superconductors and their relevant features. The goal is to predict the critical temperature based on the extracted features.

## Description

There are two files: (1) train.csv contains 81 features extracted from 21263 superconductors along with the critical temperature in the 82nd column, (2) unique_m.csv contains the chemical formula broken up for all the 21263 superconductors from the train.csv file. The last two columns have the critical temperature and chemical formula.

The original data comes from http://supercon.nims.go.jp/index_en.html which is public. The goal here is to predict the critical temperature based on the features extracted.

Please see the relevant paper for the feature explanations.
