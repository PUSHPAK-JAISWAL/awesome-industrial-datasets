## Description

This dataset is designed for automated fault detection in Industry 4.0 applications using IoT-based smart sensors. It contains data of industrial sensor data collected from various sources, including Temperature Sensors (°C), Vibration Sensors (m/s²), Pressure Sensors (kPa), Flow Rate Sensors (L/min), Current Sensors (A), and Voltage Sensors (V).

The dataset includes a Fault_Type label with four categories:
0 → No Fault (Normal Operation)
1 → Overheating Fault
2 → Leakage Fault
3 → Power Fluctuation Fault
