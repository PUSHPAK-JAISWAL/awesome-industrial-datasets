# SACAC Data Repositories

**Summary:** The data is contributed by industrial control practitioners and academic researchers, aiming to provide a test environment for control loop performance monitoring methods. The data sets are arranged according to the cause of the poor performance of the control loops.

## Description

The data is contributed by industrial control practitioners as well as by academic researchers who work closely with industry. The aim of this repository is to provide a test environment for control loop performance monitoring methods.

The data sets are arranged according to the cause of the poor performance of the control loops. These categories are described in Bauer et al. (2016) and are ordered according to how often they occur in industrial processes.

For any queries or if you would like to contribute industrial process data please send us an email at: piddata@sacac.org.za
