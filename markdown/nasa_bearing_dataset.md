## Description

Four Rexnord ZA-2115 double row bearings were installed on a shaft rotating at a constant speed of 2000 RPM with a radial load of 6000 lbs applied. The dataset consists of vibration signals captured using PCB 353B33 High Sensitivity Quartz ICP accelerometers installed on bearing housings. Data was collected from three test-to-failure experiments, where each file contains a 1-second vibration signal snapshot with 20,480 data points sampled at 20 kHz.

The dataset includes three sets of test data with varying numbers of channels and recording durations. File intervals are mostly every 10 minutes, and failures include inner and outer race defects across different bearings. The data is in ASCII format and provided with documentation including a README document.

This dataset is provided by the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS), University of Cincinnati and originally collected by NASA Ames Research Center. It is utilized for developing prognostic models for machine health and failure prediction.
