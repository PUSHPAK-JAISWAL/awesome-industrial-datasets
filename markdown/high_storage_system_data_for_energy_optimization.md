## Description

The dataset originates from the Smartfactory in Lemgo, which demonstrates a high storage system previously used in research projects like IMPROVE. Its focus is on data-driven energy optimization and is also used for anomaly detection using timed automata.

The high storage system consists of 4 short conveyor belts and 2 rails, with the conveyor belts equipped with induction sensors. It uses a SPS with Codesys V3, following the IEC61131-Standard. The system transports packages between two spots with runs recorded for both optimized and non-optimized processes, including those with anomalies.

The data files are split into four CSV files covering normal runs without failures (non-optimized and optimized) and runs with failures (non-optimized and optimized). The Label column marks anomalies, enabling tests on energy-based optimization and anomaly detection tasks. The dataset is publicly available under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.
