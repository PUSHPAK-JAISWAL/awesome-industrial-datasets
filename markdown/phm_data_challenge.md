## Description

The PHM Data Challenge is a competition centered on fault detection and prognostics in industrial plants, where participants use sensor and control signal time series data to predict future failure events and their timings. The data includes measurements from multiple plant components and zones, with fault events characterized by start time, end time, and fault code. The sampling frequency is roughly one sample every 15 minutes over approximately three to four years.

Data sets include training data for approximately thirty plants and test data for about ten plants, with some fault data missing in the test set to simulate real-world prediction challenges. Physical plant model information provided explains feedback loop control systems and measurement zones. The dataset has inconsistencies such as variable sampling intervals and missing data, requiring careful preprocessing and analysis.

Participants submit predictions of faults for scoring based on detection accuracy with penalties for false positives and negatives. The data challenge facilitates collaboration among students, researchers, and industry professionals and aims to advance machine learning methods for prognostics and health management.
