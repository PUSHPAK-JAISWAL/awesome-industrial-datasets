# Robot Execution Failures

## Dataset Information
The donation includes 5 datasets, each of them defining a different learning problem:

    * LP1: failures in approach to grasp position
    * LP2: failures in transfer of a part
    * LP3: position of part after a transfer failure
    * LP4: failures in approach to ungrasp position
    * LP5: failures in motion with part

In order to improve classification accuracy, a set of five feature transformation strategies (based on statistical summary features, discrete Fourier transform, etc.) was defined and evaluated. This enabled an average improvement of 20% in accuracy. The most accessible reference is [Seabra Lopes and Camarinha-Matos, 1998].
