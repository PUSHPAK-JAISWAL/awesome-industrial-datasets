## Dataset Information

It is not always easy to find databases from real-world manufacturing plants So, I would like to share this database with the community, which comes from one of the biggest industry in Brazil and in the world.
The primary reason why we are sharing this data is that there is an urgent need for companies to understand why employees still suffer some injuries/accidents in plants. Sometimes they also die in such environment. So hope the community help us to explore and take better/newer insights from this data.

## Content

The database is basically records of accidents from 12 different plants in 03 different countries where every line in the data is an occurrence of an accident.
