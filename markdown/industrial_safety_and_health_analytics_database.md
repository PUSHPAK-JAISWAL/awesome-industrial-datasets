## Description

It is not always easy to find databases from real-world manufacturing plants, so this database is shared from one of the biggest industries in Brazil and the world. The primary motivation is to help companies understand why employees still suffer injuries or accidents in plants, sometimes resulting in death. The hope is to enable community-driven exploration and extraction of new insights to improve industrial safety.

The database consists of records of accidents from 12 different plants in 3 different countries, where every row denotes an occurrence of an accident. The dataset includes time/date information, anonymized country and city location, industry sector, accident severity levels, potential accident severity, gender of the injured, whether the injured is an employee or third party, descriptions of critical risks involved, and detailed descriptions of how the accident occurred.

This dataset is intended to enable data-driven solutions and research in industrial safety and health to help save lives and enhance workplace safety protocols. It is released under a CC0: Public Domain license for open community use.
