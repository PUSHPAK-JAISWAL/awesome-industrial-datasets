## Description

IndPenSim provides realistic process data mimicking an industrial penicillin fermentation process. The dataset includes 100 simulated batch runs divided into four categories: (1) batches 1–30: recipe-driven control, (2) batches 31–60: operator-controlled, (3) batches 61–90: advanced process control with Raman probe, and (4) batches 91–100: fault-injected runs.

The data includes typical bioprocess measurements such as dissolved oxygen, viscosity, pH, CO₂, and temperature, alongside simulated Raman spectroscopy signals. This dataset is particularly suitable for research in process monitoring, soft sensing, quality-by-design, PAT (Process Analytical Technology), and advanced control strategies.
