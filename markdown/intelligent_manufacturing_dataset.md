## Description

The Intelligent Manufacturing Dataset for Predictive Optimization is designed for smart manufacturing research, AI-driven process optimization, and predictive maintenance. It simulates real-time sensor data from industrial machines and incorporates 6G network slicing for enhanced communication and resource allocation.

Key features include industrial IoT sensor data (temperature, vibration, power consumption), 6G network performance metrics (latency, packet loss, communication efficiency), production efficiency indicators (defect rate, predictive maintenance score), and a target column Efficiency_Status classifying efficiency levels. The dataset serves as a benchmark for AI and deep learning applications in Industry 4.0 and 6G-integrated manufacturing systems.
