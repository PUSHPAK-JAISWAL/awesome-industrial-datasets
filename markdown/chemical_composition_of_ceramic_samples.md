# Chemical Composition of Ceramic Samples

**Summary:** Classify ceramic samples based on their chemical composition from energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence. We hope to identify chemical elements that are strongest explanatory variables to classify samples into different cultural eras and kilns.

## Description

The energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) was used to determine the chemical composition of celadon body and glaze in Longquan kiln (at Dayao County) and Jingdezhen kiln. Forty typical shards in four cultural eras were selected to investigate the raw materials and firing technology.

We hope to identify chemical elements that are strongest explanatory variables to classify samples into different cultural eras and kilns.
