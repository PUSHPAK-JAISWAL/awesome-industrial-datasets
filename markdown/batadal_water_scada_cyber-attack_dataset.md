# BATADAL Water SCADA Cyber-Attack Dataset

**Summary:** The BATADAL dataset comprises simulated hourly SCADA telemetry for a water distribution network. It includes normal operation data without attacks, partially labeled attack data, and unlabeled test data with various cyber attacks.

## Description

The dataset includes Training Dataset 1, a one-year simulation released on November 20 2016 that contains only normal C-Town operations without any attacks. Training Dataset 2, released on November 28 2016, spans approximately six months and contains several attacks with approximate labels. The Test Dataset, released on February 20 2017, covers three months and contains multiple attacks but no labels, used for performance comparison of detection algorithms.

Flow data unit is LPS, and pressure and water level units are meters.

Two additional obsolete datasets (Old Dataset 1 and Old Dataset 2) were originally included but later removed due to differing demand patterns.
