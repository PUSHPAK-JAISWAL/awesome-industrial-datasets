## Description

This dataset contains data on steel plates faults classified into seven types: Pastry, Z_Scratch, K_Scatch, Stains, Dirtiness, Bumps, and Other_Faults. The dataset includes 27 independent variables with integer and real feature types.

The dataset aims to provide records to train machine learning models for automatic pattern recognition in fault detection on steel plates. The dataset contains no missing values and is based on real data.

The features describe various physical properties and measurements related to the steel plates, such as X_Minimum, X_Maximum, Y_Minimum, Y_Maximum, Pixels_Areas, X_Perimeter, Y_Perimeter, and Luminosity indices among others.
