## Description

The NASA Ames Intelligent Systems Division provides leadership in information technologies by conducting mission-driven, user-centric research and development in computational sciences for NASA applications. We develop ground and flight software systems and data architectures for data mining, analysis, integration, and management; integrated health management; systems safety; and mission assurance.

We transfer these new capabilities for utilization in support of NASA missions and initiatives. The Division is part of Ames Research Center’s Exploration Technologies Directorate, which provides advanced technologies for NASA’s Aeronautics Research, Science, Human Exploration and Operations, and Space Technology Mission Directorates, as well as mission support organizations within the Agency.

Over 400 NASA civil servant employees, contractors, and student interns work at the division.
