## Description

This dataset provides chemical production data for India from 2013-14 to 2020-21 across various major chemical product groups. Production figures have been aggregated based on monthly production returns submitted directly to the Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals from manufacturers operating at large and medium scales.

The data presents the production quantities of different chemicals in metric tonnes, categorized by chemical groups such as Alkali Chemicals, Inorganic Chemicals, Organic Chemicals, and Pesticides and Insecticides. The dataset is intended to support data science tasks like exploratory data analysis and visualization related to industrial chemical production trends in India.

Credits for the data collection and aggregation are given to the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers and the Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals, Government of India. The dataset is shared under a CC0 Public Domain license via Kaggle.
