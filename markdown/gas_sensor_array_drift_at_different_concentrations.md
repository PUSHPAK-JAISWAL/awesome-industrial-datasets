## Description

This data set contains 13,910 measurements from 16 chemical sensors exposed to 6 gases at different concentration levels. This dataset is an extension of the Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset, providing now the information about the concentration level at which the sensors were exposed for each measurement. The primary purpose of making this dataset freely accessible on-line is to provide an extensive dataset to the sensor and artificial intelligence research communities to develop and test strategies to solve a wide variety of tasks, including sensor drift, classification, regression, among others.

This dataset was gathered during the period of January 2008 to February 2011 (36 months) in a gas delivery platform facility situated at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. The measurement system platform provides versatility for obtaining the desired concentrations of the chemical substances of interest with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner, minimizing thereby the common mistakes caused by human intervention and making it possible to exclusively concentrate on the chemical sensors.

The responses of the said sensors are read in the form of the resistance across the active layer of each sensor; hence, each measurement produced a 16-channel time series, each  represented by an aggregate of features reflecting the dynamic processes occurring at the sensor surface in reaction to the chemical substance being evaluated. In particular, two distinct types of features were considered in the creation of this dataset
