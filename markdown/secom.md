## Dataset Information
Data from a semi-conductor manufacturing process. This data includes complex modern semi-conductor manufacturing process details which are normally under consistent surveillance via the monitoring of signals/variables collected from sensors and process measurement points. The dataset presented represents a selection of features where each example represents a single production entity with associated measured features. The labels represent a simple pass/fail yield for in-house line testing and associated date-time stamp.

## Variable Information
Key facts: Data Structure: The data consists of 2 files - the dataset file SECOM consisting of 1567 examples each with 591 features and a labels file containing the classifications and date time stamp for each example. The data contains null values which vary in intensity depending on the individual features. The data is represented in a raw text file with each line representing an individual example and the features separated by spaces.

## Additional Information
A complex modern semi-conductor manufacturing process is normally under consistent surveillance via the monitoring of signals/variables collected from sensors and or process measurement points. Engineers typically have a much larger number of signals than are actually required. Feature selection may be applied to identify the most relevant signals. The dataset presented in this case represents a selection of such features where each example represents a single production entity with associated measured features and the labels represent a simple pass/fail yield for in house line testing, figure 2, and associated date time stamp. Using feature selection techniques it is desired to rank features according to their impact on the overall yield for the product, causal relationships may also be considered with a view to identifying the key features.
