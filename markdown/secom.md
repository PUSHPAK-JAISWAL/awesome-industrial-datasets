## Dataset Information

Key facts: Data Structure: The data consists of 2 files—the dataset file SECOM consisting of 1567 examples, each with 591 features, forming a 1567 x 591 matrix, and a labels file containing the classifications and date-time stamp for each example.

As with any real-life data situations, this data contains null values, varying in intensity depending on the individual features. This needs to be taken into consideration when investigating the data, either through pre-processing or within the technique applied.

The data is represented in a raw text file, each line representing an individual example, and the features separated by spaces. The null values are represented by the 'NaN' value as per MATLAB.
