## Description

The dataset is based on the Ultimaker S5 3D printer settings and filaments, with materials and strength tests carried out on a Sincotec GMBH tester capable of pulling 20 kN.

It comprises nine setting parameters including layer height, wall thickness, infill density and pattern, nozzle and bed temperature, print speed, material, and fan speed. The measured output parameters are roughness, tension (ultimate) strength, and elongation.

The study attempts to estimate which material is used based on input and output parameters using kNN and DNN algorithms. This dataset supports mechanical engineering research and machine learning analysis for 3D printing parameters.
