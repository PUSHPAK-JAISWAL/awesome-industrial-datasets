## Description

The NEU Surface Defect Dataset is a collection of six common surface defects on hot-rolled steel strips.

The dataset is intended for the purpose of machine learning research on surface defect detection and classification in industrial steel production. It provides labeled image data that include typical surface defects such as crazing, inclusion, patches, pitted surface, rolled-in scale, and scratches.

The dataset can be used to develop and test image classification algorithms, helping improve the quality inspection process in steel manufacturing.
