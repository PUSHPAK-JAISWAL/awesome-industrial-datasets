## Description

This dataset corresponds to sensor signals from several cutting tests including two perpendicular single axis accelerometers, a tri-axial accelerometer, a microphone, and a laser tachometer. The dataset includes both raw data from all sensors and conditioned, tagged data from one channel of the tri-axial accelerometer. The data is tagged with categories: no-chatter, intermediate chatter, chatter, and unknown.

The cutting test was performed by turning an Aluminum 6061 workpiece on a Clasuing-Gamet 33 cm (13 inch) engine lathe using a Titanium nitride coated insert attached to an S10R-SCLCR3S boring bar. Data was collected from four different cutting configurations, each defined by the stickout distance (ranging from 5.08 cm to 11.43 cm). For each stickout distance, data were collected for various combinations of rotational speed and depth of cut.

The dataset includes a table detailing parameter combinations and the number of tagged time series per stickout length within the included documents, and a brief description of the tagging algorithm used is also provided.
