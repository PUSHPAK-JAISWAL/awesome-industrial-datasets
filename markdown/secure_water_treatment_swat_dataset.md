## Dataset Information

11 days of continuous operation: 7 under normal operation and 4 days with attack scenarios.
Collected network traffic and all the values obtained from all 51 sensors and actuators.
Data labeled according to normal and abnormal behaviors.
Attack Scenarios: Derived through the attack models developed by our research team. The attack model considers the intent space of a CPS as an attack model. 41 attacks were launched during the 4 days and are described in the PDF.
