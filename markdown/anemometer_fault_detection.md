# Anemometer Fault Detection

**Summary:** The PHM Data Challenge focuses on anemometer fault detection, a critical problem for the wind power industry. Participants are scored based on their ability to identify faulty anemometers in two data sets.

## Description

The PHM Data Challenge is a competition focused on anemometer fault detection, a critical problem for the wind power industry, strongly affecting among other things the financing of a potential site. Both Student and Professional teams are encouraged to enter! Winners of the Student and the Professional categories who attend the conference and submit an invited paper to ijPHM on their technique will be awarded a cash prize. Top scoring participants will be invited to present at a special session of the conference.

There are two data sets, one for “paired” data, and one for “shear” data. The paired data consist of 12 training sets of nominal, paired anemometer data from the same height. Each training set consists of 25 days of data. The test data consists of 420 test files, of 5 days of data. The shear data consist of 7 training sets of nominal, anemometer data in an array from different heights. Each training set consists of 25 days of data. The test data consists of 255 test files, of 5 days of data.

The paired data contains 16 columns of comma separated data: mean, standard deviation, maximum, minimum wind speed for two anemometers, wind direction, and temperature. The shear data contains 20 or 16 columns of comma separated data: height data, mean, standard deviation, maximum, minimum wind speed for anemometers at different heights, wind direction, temperature, and date.
