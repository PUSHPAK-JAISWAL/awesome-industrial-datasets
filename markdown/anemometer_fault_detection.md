## Description

The PHM Data Challenge is a competition open to all potential conference attendees. This year the challenge is focused on anemometer fault detection, a critical problem for the wind power industry, strongly affecting among other things the financing of a potential site.

There are two data sets, one for “paired” data, and one for “shear” data. The paired data consist of 12 training sets of nominal, paired anemometer data from the same height. Each training set consists of 25 days of data. The test data consists of 420 test files, of 5 days of data. There are 16 columns of comma separated data, including features for two anemometers’ wind speed statistics, wind direction, and temperature.

The shear data consists of 7 training sets of nominal anemometer data in an array from different heights, with 25 days of data per set. The test data consists of 255 test files, each of 5 days. Each data set includes between 16 and 20 columns representing anemometer wind speed statistics at different heights, wind direction, temperature, and date/time. Participants are scored based on their ability to identify faulty anemometers in these two datasets.
