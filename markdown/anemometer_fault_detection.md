## Description

The PHM Data Challenge is a competition open to all potential conference attendees, focused on anemometer fault detection which is important for the wind power industry. Participants are scored based on their ability to identify faulty anemometers in two data sets. There are two categories for teams: Professional and Student, with cash prizes awarded to winners who meet certain requirements.

The data includes two datasets: paired data and shear data. The paired data consist of 12 training sets of nominal, paired anemometer data from the same height, with 25 days of data each, and 420 test files of 5 days each with 16 columns of data including statistics of wind speeds, wind direction, and temperature. The shear data consists of 7 training sets of nominal anemometer data from different heights, with 25 days of data each, and 255 test files of 5 days each, consisting of 16 or 20 columns including height data, wind speed statistics for up to four anemometers, wind direction, temperature, and date/time information.

Registration is done by contacting the competition organizers, with rules to prevent multiple entries per team. Questions and additional information are available on the competition forum. Top scoring teams are invited to present at a special session of the conference and submit papers to the International Journal of Prognostics and Health Management (ijPHM).
