## Description

The Garment Industry is one of the key examples of the industrial globalization of this modern era. It is a highly labour-intensive industry with lots of manual processes. Satisfying the huge global demand for garment products is mostly dependent on the production and delivery performance of the employees in the garment manufacturing companies.

So, it is highly desirable among the decision makers in the garments industry to track, analyse and predict the productivity performance of the working teams in their factories. This dataset can be used for regression purpose by predicting the productivity range (0-1) or for classification purpose by transforming the productivity range (0-1) into different classes.

The dataset contains 14 features describing various aspects such as date, day of the week, quarter of the month, department, team number, number of workers, style changes, targeted productivity, standard minute value (SMV), work in progress, overtime amount, financial incentives, idle time, and idle men. Some features contain missing values, particularly the work in progress (wip) feature.
