## Dataset Information

We provide 2 datasets: iV2V (industrial Vehicle-to-Vehicle) and iV2I+ (industrial Vehicular-to-Infrastructure + sensor). Both datasets provide information from several sources in different granularity. For ease of use, parquet files containing direct translations of the raw data are provided in respective sources folders.
