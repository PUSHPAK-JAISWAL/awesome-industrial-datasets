## Description

Welcome to the Factory Sensor Simulator dataset, a large-scale synthetic dataset designed for predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and industrial machine learning applications in the context of Industry 5.0.

This dataset contains sensor readings, operational metrics, and maintenance records from 500,000 simulated machines deployed in a futuristic smart factory environment. It includes 30+ realistic machine types (e.g., CNC_Mill, Furnace, Robot_Arm, Laser_Cutter); core sensor data such as temperature, vibration, sound, power, oil and coolant levels; maintenance history and AI supervision fields; machine-specific features like Laser_Intensity and Hydraulic_Pressure_bar; and two target columns (Remaining_Useful_Life_days for regression and Failure_Within_7_Days for binary classification).

No real-world data was used. All data is fully synthetic, created to mimic realistic industrial trends for safe exploration and modeling.
