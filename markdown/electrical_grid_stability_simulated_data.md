# Electrical Grid Stability Simulated Data

## Dataset Information
The analysis is performed for different sets of input values using the methodology similar to that described in [SchÃ¤fer, Benjamin, et al. 'Taming instabilities in power grid networks by decentralized control.' The European Physical Journal Special Topics 225.3 (2016): 569-582.]. Several input values are kept the same: averaging time: 2 s; coupling strength: 8 s^-2; damping: 0.1 s^-1
