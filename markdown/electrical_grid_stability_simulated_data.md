## Description

The analysis is performed for different sets of input values using the methodology similar to that described in Schäfer, Benjamin, et al. 'Taming instabilities in power grid networks by decentralized control.' The European Physical Journal Special Topics 225.3 (2016): 569-582. Several input values are kept the same: averaging time: 2 s; coupling strength: 8 s^-2; damping: 0.1 s^-1.

The dataset contains 11 predictive attributes and 1 non-predictive attribute (p1), plus 2 goal fields. Variables include reaction times (tau[x]), nominal power values consumed or produced (p[x]), and coefficients proportional to price elasticity (g[x]). Stability is represented by maximum real parts of the characteristic equation root and a categorical stability label (stable/unstable).

This dataset is useful for studying the stability of electrical grids under decentralized control concepts and simulating various operating conditions in power networks.
