# Control loop datasets

**Summary:** Datasets collected from industrial control loops including raw, selected, and sampled data from an oil and gas company, along with an oscillation detection artificial dataset used for machine learning.

## Description

The Control loop datasets include several industrial datasets:

- SISO-RAW: Raw data collected over two and a half days from an oil and gas company with non-constant sampling time.
- SISO-SEL: Selected fragments derived from the SISO-RAW dataset.
- SISO-SAMP: Data with constant sampling time based on the SISO-SEL dataset.

Additionally, there is the Oscillation Detection Artificial Dataset (ODADS), which was used in previous work by the authors on a technique for oscillation detection based on machine learning. The datasets support research in control, modeling, simulation, and optimization of industrial processes.
