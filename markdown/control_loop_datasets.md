## Description

The page provides access to industrial datasets related to control loops. These datasets include:

SISO-RAW: Raw data collected in two and a half days from an oil and gas company with non-constant sampling time.

SISO-SEL: Selected fragments from the SISO-RAW dataset.

SISO-SAMP: Constant sampling time from the SISO-SEL dataset.

There is also an oscillation detection artificial dataset (ODADS) used by the authors’ previous work on a technique for oscillation detection based on Machine Learning.
