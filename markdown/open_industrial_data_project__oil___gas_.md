## Description

The Open Industrial Data Project is a collaboration between Aker BP, a major independent oil company in Europe, and Cognite. The dataset includes time series data, maintenance history, and process instrumentation diagrams from a single subsystem: the first stage compressor and associated equipment on the Valhall oil platform in the North Sea.

This dataset is continuously available and free of charge, designed to promote openness and collaboration in industrial data usage. It aims to accelerate innovation in data-heavy areas such as predictive maintenance, condition monitoring, and advanced visualization techniques.

The dataset is especially relevant to the oil and gas industry but is expected to inspire innovation across various industrial sectors by providing real-world industrial data for machine learning applications. Users can access the data through the Cognite Data Fusion platform, with detailed discussions and community resources available on Cognite's Open Industrial Data forum.
