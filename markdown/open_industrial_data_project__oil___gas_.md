# Open Industrial Data Project (Oil & Gas)

**Summary:** Explore a live stream of real industrial data from the Open Industrial Data Project, resulting from a collaboration between Aker BP and Cognite. The data originates from a single compressor on Aker BP’s Valhall oil platform in the North Sea.

## Description

The data originates from a single compressor on Aker BP’s Valhall oil platform in the North Sea. Aker BP selected the first stage compressor on the Valhall because it is a subsystem with clearly defined boundaries, rich in time series and maintenance data.

AkerBP uses Cognite Data Fusion to organize the data stream from this compressor. The data set available in Cognite Data Fusion includes time series data, maintenance history, and Process & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) for Valhall’s first stage compressor and associated process equipment: first stage suction cooler, first stage suction scrubber, first stage compressor and first stage discharge coolers. The data is continuously available and free of charge.

By sharing this live stream of industrial data freely, Aker BP and Cognite hope to accelerate innovation within data-heavy fields. This includes predictive maintenance, condition monitoring, and advanced visualization techniques, as well as other new, unexpected applications.
