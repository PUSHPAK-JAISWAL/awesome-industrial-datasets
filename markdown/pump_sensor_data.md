## Dataset Information

I have a friend who works in a small team responsible for maintaining the water pump systems of a remote area. Last year, there were 7 system failures that caused significant disruptions and seriously impacted some families' living conditions. The team has struggled to identify any patterns in the data related to these failures, leaving them unsure of where to focus their efforts. Believing in the power of data to solve problems, I've asked my friend to provide any available sensor data in hopes that someone here can help analyze it and find a solution.
