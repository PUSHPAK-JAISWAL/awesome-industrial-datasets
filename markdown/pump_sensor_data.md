## Description

This dataset originates from a small team monitoring water pumps in a remote area. They experienced 7 system failures in the last year, which caused serious problems to local people and some families. They were unable to detect any pattern leading to these failures from the data alone.

The dataset contains raw values from all available 52 sensors monitoring the pumps, along with timestamp data and machine status as the target label. The goal is to use this sensor data to predict pump failures to allow proactive maintenance and avoid negative impacts on the community.

The data contains multivariate time series sensor readings collected over time to support predictive maintenance, and it is intended for classification tasks to identify possible failures.
