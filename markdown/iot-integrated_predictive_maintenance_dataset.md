## Description

This dataset provides time-series sensor readings from multiple industrial machines operating on a production line, capturing realistic operational behavior under both normal and fault conditions.

Data was simulated to represent real-time collection via an IoT-enabled sensor network. Each entry includes a timestamp, a machine identifier, raw sensor measurements (vibration, acoustic signal, temperature, current), and decomposed signal features (IMF_1, IMF_2, IMF_3) reflecting complex patterns associated with equipment faults.

Key features include:
Timestamp, Machine ID, Vibration, Acoustic Signal, Temperature, Current, Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF_1, IMF_2, IMF_3), Label indicating machine state (0 = healthy, 1 = faulty).
