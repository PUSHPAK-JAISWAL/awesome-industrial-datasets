## Description

Green house gases are a significant environmental problem, contributing to the increase in global temperatures. This dataset captures detailed information on different types of gases released by various industries across different regions of the Earth.

The data includes industry-specific greenhouse gas emissions categorized by gas types such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, fluorinated gases, and total greenhouse gases. It also contains ISO tests to measure the effects. These emissions data are tracked annually starting from 2010.

This dataset allows analysis of greenhouse gas production by industry sector and region, useful for environmental research, policy making, and industrial impact assessment. The dataset contains 18 columns covering country, industry, gas type, and emission values for multiple years.
