## Description

The ISDB dataset was used in the book ‘Detection and Diagnosis of Stiction in Control Loops’ edited by Mohieddine Jelali and Biao Huang, Springer, 2009. Stiction and deadband are nonlinearities limiting control valve performance and stiction is the most common valve problem in process industries.

The dataset enables implementation of advanced methods for stiction detection, diagnosis, and quantification of multiple faults in control loops. It is accompanied by MATLAB-based software for applying and evaluating these methods, particularly focusing on oscillation detection, stiction detection, and stiction quantification.

The data and related software are made available for teaching and research. The ISDB dataset and software toolboxes are hosted by the University of Alberta and complement the methodologies described in the reference book. Contact details and additional resources are available through the hosting webpage.
