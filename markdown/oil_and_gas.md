## Description

This dataset provides comprehensive historical data on global oil and natural gas production, pricing, exports, and net exports spanning many decades. Oil production and price data cover years from 1932 to 2014, with the 2014 data noted as incomplete; gas production and price data span from 1955 to 2014; export and net export data cover the period from 1986 to 2013. Country codes within the dataset have been adjusted to conform with the Correlates of War (COW) and Quality of Government (QOG) standards to maintain consistency.

The collected data allow analysis of historical trends and relationships in the oil and gas industry worldwide, supporting various research and learning activities. The dataset is well-documented and is useful for regression and forecasting tasks, potentially assisting in price variation studies from the 1900s to the 2000s and other economic and production-related analyses.

Acknowledgment is given to the original dataset authors Michael Ross and Paasha Mahdavi and is made available via Harvard Dataverse and Kaggle. The dataset includes 41 columns and one CSV data file named 'Oil and Gas 1932-2014.csv' with a size of approximately 3.79 MB.
