## Dataset Information

Run-to-failure data: Engine degradation simulation was carried out using the C-MAPSS tool. Four different sets were simulated under different combinations of operational conditions and fault modes. Several sensor channels were recorded to characterize fault evolution.
The data set was provided by the Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames. The set is in text format and has been zipped including a readme file. Please cite: 'A. Saxena and K. Goebel (2008).
