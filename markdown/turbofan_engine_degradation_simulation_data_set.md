## Description

PHM08 Challenge Dataset is publicly available at the NASA Prognostics Repository with an online evaluation utility allowing users to test their results and receive feedback on the test dataset.

The dataset was simulated using the C-MAPSS tool, capturing engine degradation run-to-failure data. It includes four different sets simulated under various combinations of operational conditions and fault modes with several sensor channels recorded to characterize fault evolution.

The data set is provided by the Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames in text format, packaged with a readme file. It supports prognostics and health management research with simulated turbofan engine degradation data.
