## Description

This repository provides normal insulator images captured by UAVs and synthetic defective insulator images.

Timely detection of undesirable events can help prevent production losses, reduce maintenance costs, environmental accidents, and human casualties.

The dataset can be used to promote experimentation and development of Machine Learning-based approaches and algorithms for specific problems related to detection and classification of undesirable events.
