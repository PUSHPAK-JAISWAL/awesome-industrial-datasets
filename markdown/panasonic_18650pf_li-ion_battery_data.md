## Description

The included tests were performed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison by Dr. Phillip Kollmeyer. If this data is utilized for any purpose, it should be appropriately referenced.

The tests can be used to test Neural Network and Kalman Filter State of Charge algorithms, or to develop battery models, and are intended to be a reference so researchers can compare their algorithm and model performance for a standard data set.

For the tests, a brand new 2.9Ah Panasonic 18650PF cell was tested in an 8 cu.ft. thermal chamber with a 25 amp, 18 volt Digatron Firing Circuits Universal Battery Tester channel. A series of tests, including HPPC, drive cycles, and impedance spectroscopy, were performed at five different temperatures. The battery was charged after each test at a 1C rate to 4.2V, 50mA cut off, with battery temperature 12degC or greater). See the readme file for additional details.
