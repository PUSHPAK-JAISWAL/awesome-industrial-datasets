## Description

The included tests were performed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison by Dr. Phillip Kollmeyer. The data can be used to test Neural Network and Kalman Filter State of Charge algorithms or to develop battery models. It is intended as a reference dataset for benchmarking algorithm and model performance.

A brand new 2.9Ah Panasonic 18650PF cell was tested in an 8 cu.ft. thermal chamber using a 25 amp, 18 volt Digatron Universal Battery Tester channel. The series of tests included HPPC, drive cycles, and impedance spectroscopy, all performed at five different temperatures. The battery was charged after each test at a 1C rate to 4.2V with a 50mA cutoff and a battery temperature of 12°C or greater.

Several publications have utilized this dataset, including IEEE papers on Long Short-Term Memory Networks for accurate State-of-Charge estimation and recurrent neural network methodologies for lithium-ion battery voltage modeling. The dataset aims to provide a standard benchmark for battery State of Charge and modeling research.
