## Description

The Tennessee Eastman Process simulation dataset is based on a simulated chemical process that is commonly used as a benchmark for fault detection and diagnosis algorithms. It includes data under various normal and faulty operating conditions, generated by a dynamic model developed by Eastman Chemical Company. This dataset simulates realistic multivariate time-series data from a complicated chemical process including multiple sensors and process variables.

The dataset consists of time series data under different injected faults scenarios used to evaluate and compare the performance of monitoring algorithms. The data includes both normal and faulty process operation to facilitate identification and classification of abnormal conditions. Due to the complexity and dynamic nature of the simulated process, this dataset is valuable for machine learning and statistical methods research in process monitoring and fault detection.

It is used extensively in research, providing a critical testbed for developing advanced process monitoring methods, including anomaly detection, classification, and predictive maintenance strategies.
