## Description

The Beijing PM2.5 Data set contains hourly data from January 1st, 2010 to December 31st, 2014. It includes PM2.5 pollution measurements from the US Embassy in Beijing along with meteorological data such as Dew Point, Temperature, Pressure, wind direction, cumulated wind speed, snow, and rain hours from Beijing Capital International Airport.

Missing values are denoted as "NA" in the dataset. The dataset captures climate and environmental observations useful for applications in regression tasks related to pollution prediction.

The features include temporal variables (year, month, day, hour), PM2.5 as the target variable, and meteorological features DEWP (Dew Point), TEMP (Temperature), PRES (Pressure), cbwd (Combined wind direction), Iws (Cumulated wind speed), Is (Cumulated hours of snow), and Ir (Cumulated hours of rain).
