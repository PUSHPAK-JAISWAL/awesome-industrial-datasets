## Dataset Information

This Data Package contains a list of renewable energy power plants in lists of renewable energy-based power plants of Czechia, Denmark, France, Germany, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom. Czechia: Renewable-energy power plants in Czech Republic. Denmark: Wind and phovoltaic power plants with a high level of detail. France: Renewable-energy power plants of various types (solar, hydro, wind, bioenergy marine, geothermal) in France. Germany: Individual power plants, all renewable energy plants supported by the German Renewable Energy Law (EEG). Poland: Summed capacity and number of installations per energy source per municipality (Powiat). Sweden: Wind power plants in Sweden. Switzerland: All renewable-energy power plants supported by the feed-in-tariff KEV (Kostendeckende Einspeisevergütung). United Kingdom: Renewable-energy power plants in the United Kingdom. Due to different data availability, the power plant lists are of different accurancy and partly provide different power plant parameter. Due to that, the lists are provided as seperate csv-files per country. Suspect data or entries with high probability of duplication are marked in the column 'comment'. Theses validation markers are explained in the file validation_marker.csv. Additionally, the Data Package includes daily time series of cumulated installed capacity per energy source type for Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Sweden.
