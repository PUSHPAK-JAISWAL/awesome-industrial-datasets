## Data Set Information
A set of four Li-ion batteries were run through 3 different operational profiles (charge, discharge and impedance) at room temperature (24 deg C).

## Attribute Information
- type : operation  type, can be charge, discharge or impedance
- ambient_temperature : ambient temperature (degree C)
- time : the date and time of the start of the cycle, in MATLAB  date vector format
