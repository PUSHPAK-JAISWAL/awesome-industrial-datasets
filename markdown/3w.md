## Description

This repository supports the 3W Project, which aims to promote experimentation and development of Machine Learning-based approaches and algorithms for specific problems related to detection and classification of undesirable events that occur in offshore oil wells.

The name **3W** was chosen because this dataset is composed of instances from ***3*** different sources and which contain undesirable events that occur in oil ***W***ells.
