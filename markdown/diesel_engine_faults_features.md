## Description

The objective of this dataset is the fault diagnosis in diesel engines to assist the predictive maintenance, through the analysis of the variation of the pressure curves inside the cylinders and the torsional vibration response of the crankshaft. Hence a fault simulation model based on a zero-dimensional thermodynamic model was developed.

The adopted feature vectors were chosen from the thermodynamic model and obtained from processing signals as pressure and temperature inside the cylinder, as well as, torsional vibration of the engine’s flywheel. These vectors are used as input of the machine learning technique in order to discriminate among several machine conditions.

The entire database comprises a total of 3500 different fault scenarios for 4 distinct operational conditions. 250 of which from the normal class, 250 from ``pressure reduction in the intake manifold" class, 1500 from ``compression ratio reduction in the cylinders" class and 1500 from the ``reduction of amount of fuel injected into the cylinders" class. This database is named 3500-DEFault database.
