# ECO dataset

**Summary:** The ECO data set is a comprehensive dataset for non-intrusive load monitoring and occupancy detection research, collected in 6 Swiss households over 8 months.

## Description

The ECO data set provides 1 Hz aggregate electricity consumption data including current, voltage, and phase shift for each of the three phases in the households. It also includes 1 Hz plug-level data from selected appliances and occupancy information measured via manual labeling on a tablet and passive infrared sensors in some households.

The data was collected in the context of the Smart Meter Services project at ETH Zurich and is related to the open source NILM-Eval framework used to evaluate non-intrusive load monitoring algorithms and work on opportunistic occupancy sensing. An interactive dashboard application is available for browsing and downloading chunks of the dataset.

The project acknowledges the support from Energie Thun and participating households, as well as contributions from several students in gathering, analyzing, and visualizing the data.
