## Description

The Deep PCB dataset is intended for research and development in surface defect detection for printed circuit boards (PCBs). It contains images of PCBs where defects on the surface are labeled for use in machine learning tasks, particularly classification.

The dataset supports the development and evaluation of algorithms that can detect and classify surface defects in industrial PCB manufacturing processes, contributing to quality control and automation in electronics production. The dataset and related code are available on GitHub under the Surface-Defect-Detection repository.

Users can leverage this dataset to build and benchmark machine learning models for defect detection, benefiting from the labeled real-world data of PCB surfaces provided in the repository.
