## Description

This dataset provides insights into factors influencing defect rates in a manufacturing environment. Each record represents various metrics crucial for predicting high or low defect occurrences in production processes.

It encompasses a comprehensive collection of metrics vital for predicting defect rates in manufacturing operations. It includes production volumes, supply chain quality, quality control assessments, maintenance schedules, inventory management details, workforce productivity metrics, energy consumption patterns, additive manufacturing specifics, and more.

The dataset is synthetic and was generated for educational purposes, making it ideal for data science and machine learning projects. It is original and made available under the CC BY 4.0 license with a DOI for proper attribution. The dataset is imbalanced, with a focus on defect instances because defects do not occur often; balancing is suggested before applying machine learning techniques.
