## Dataset Information

This dataset provides insights into factors influencing defect rates in a manufacturing environment. Each record represents various metrics crucial for predicting high or low defect occurrences in production processes.
The dataset focuses on defect instances more because they do not occur often. However, non-defect instances were added too for this reason the dataset is imbalanced, consider balancing it before proceeding with machine learning techniques.
