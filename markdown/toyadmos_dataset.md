# ToyADMOS dataset

**Summary:** ToyADMOS is a machine operating sounds dataset containing approximately 540 hours of normal operating sounds and over 12,000 anomalous sound samples collected with four microphones at a 48kHz sampling rate. It includes three sub-datasets—toy car, toy conveyor, and toy train—for different machine inspection and fault diagnosis tasks.

## Description

ToyADMOS dataset is a machine operating sounds dataset of approximately 540 hours of normal machine operating sounds and over 12,000 samples of anomalous sounds collected with four microphones at a 48kHz sampling rate, prepared by Yuma Koizumi and members in NTT Media Intelligence Laboratories. The dataset consists of three sub-datasets: “toy car” for product inspection tasks, “toy conveyor” for fault diagnosis of fixed machines, and “toy train” for fault diagnosis of moving machines.

Since the total size of the ToyADMOS dataset is over 440GB, each sub-dataset is split into 7–9 files using 7-zip (7z format). The total size of the compressed dataset is approximately 180GB, and each sub-dataset is approximately 60GB. Users can download the split archive files and use their preferred compression tool to extract the data.

Further details of the dataset are described in [1] and on GitHub: https://github.com/YumaKoizumi/ToyADMOS-dataset. License information is provided in the file named LICENSE.pdf.
