## Description

The NASA Ames Intelligent Systems Division conducts mission-driven, user-centric research and development in computational sciences to support NASA missions. Their work includes developing ground and flight software systems and data architectures for data mining, analysis, integration, and management; integrated health management; systems safety; and mission assurance.

Located at Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley, the division consists of four focused research areas: Autonomous Systems and Robotics, Collaborative and Assistant Systems, Discovery and Systems Health, and Robust Software Engineering. The division supports various NASA applications in space, aviation, and wildfire management through advanced technologies and software.

The Division features several projects such as ARMADAS, Astrobee, BioSentinel, FLUTE, MTS, ODIN-fire, PCoE, ProgPy, Starling, and VIPER, which comprise systems ranging from autonomous assembly to software architectures for wildfire management and tools for space missions. These projects support various research, simulation, and mission operation needs within NASA.
