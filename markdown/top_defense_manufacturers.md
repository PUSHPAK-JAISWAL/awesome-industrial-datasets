## Description

A defense contractor is a business organization or individual that provides products or services to a military or intelligence department of a government. Products include military or civilian aircraft, ships, vehicles, weaponry, and electronic systems, while services include logistics, technical support, training, communications support, and engineering support in cooperation with the government.

Security contractors usually do not provide direct support of military operations. In the United States, defense contracting has expanded significantly, with contractors often outnumbering military personnel in conflict zones. For example, during the first four years of the Iraq War, more than 190,000 contractors were hired, surpassing the American military presence.
