# Asset Failure and Replacement

**Summary:** This dataset focuses on asset health calculation, a common problem in industrial remote monitoring and diagnostics. Participants are scored on their ability to generate a health score that accurately segments a population of assets into high and low risks of failure.

## Description

The PHM Data Challenge focuses on asset health calculation, a common problem in industrial remote monitoring and diagnostics. Participants are scored on their ability to generate a health score that accurately segments a population of assets into high and low risks of failure.

There are 5 data sets. Due to proprietary concerns we cannot provide a detailed description of the data and the domain. The datasets include Train – Part Consumption.csv, Train – Usage.csv, Train – Failures.csv, Test – Part Consumption.csv, Test – Usage.csv, Test Instances.csv, and Example Submission.csv.

Each team is permitted one submission a week. A submission will be composed of a CSV file whose name is the team alias. The first line of the CSV file should be the value that segments the health scores into low and high risk.
