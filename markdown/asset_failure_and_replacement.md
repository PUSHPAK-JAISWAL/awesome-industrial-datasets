# Asset Failure and Replacement

**Summary:** The PHM Data Challenge dataset focuses on asset health calculation in industrial remote monitoring and diagnostics. It includes records of asset part replacements, usage, and failures to generate health scores for assets.

## Description

The PHM Data Challenge is an open competition centered on asset health calculation, a common problem in industrial remote monitoring and diagnostics. Participants are evaluated on their ability to generate health scores that accurately segment assets into high and low failure risks.

The dataset consists of five data files: Train – Part Consumption, Train – Usage, Train – Failures, Test – Part Consumption, Test – Usage, and Test Instances. These files include information about asset part replacements with reasons, usage parameters resembling an odometer, and failure times. An example submission file is also provided.

Due to proprietary concerns, detailed descriptions of the data and the domain are not provided. The challenge encourages collaboration among students, researchers, and professionals, with the top teams invited to present their findings at the PHM Society Conference.
