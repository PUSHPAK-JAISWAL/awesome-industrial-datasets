## Description

This repository contains data for the PHM 2015 data challenge. The challenge likely involves using machine learning techniques for the detection and classification of faults in a plant or industrial setting.

The data is likely multivariate and time-series, originating from real-world sensors and systems. The specific details of the data, such as the number of instances and features, are not explicitly provided on the page but can probably be found on the challenge official website.

The dataset and challenge are organized by the PHM Society.
