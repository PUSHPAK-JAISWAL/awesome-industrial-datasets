## Description

This repository contains additional simulation data from the Tennessee Eastman Process, a widely used benchmark for evaluating process monitoring and fault diagnosis techniques.

These datasets are specifically designed to evaluate anomaly detection methods, providing a diverse set of simulated scenarios to test the robustness and sensitivity of different algorithms.

The data includes both normal operating conditions and various types of simulated faults or anomalies, allowing researchers to assess the ability of their methods to detect and identify deviations from normal behavior in a complex industrial process.
