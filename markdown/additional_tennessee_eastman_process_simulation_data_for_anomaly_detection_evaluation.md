## Description

The dataset supplements the Tennessee Eastman Process simulation data with additional scenarios for anomaly detection evaluation. It aims to support the development and benchmarking of machine learning models designed to detect faults and anomalies in chemical process control systems. The data simulates multivariate time series signals representing sensor measurements and process variables under various operational and fault conditions.

The data is generated using a high-fidelity simulation of the Tennessee Eastman Process, a well-known benchmark in process monitoring and fault detection studies. This additional dataset extends the original by providing new and varied fault scenarios, enhancing the scope for testing robust anomaly detection algorithms. It is particularly useful for researchers and practitioners involved in industrial process control and predictive maintenance, offering realistic and complex data for model training and evaluation.
