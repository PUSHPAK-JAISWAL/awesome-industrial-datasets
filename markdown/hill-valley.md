# Hill-Valley

**Summary:** Each record represents 100 points on a two-dimensional graph. When plotted in order (from 1 through 100) as the Y co-ordinate, the points will create either a Hill (a âbumpâ in the terrain) or a Valley (a âdipâ in the terrain).

## Description

Each record represents 100 points on a two-dimensional graph. When plotted in order (from 1 through 100) as the Y co-ordinate, the points will create either a Hill (a âbumpâ in the terrain) or a Valley (a âdipâ in the terrain).

There are six files, as follows:
(a) Hill_Valley_without_noise_Training.data
(b) Hill_Valley_without_noise_Testing.data
These first two datasets (without noise) are a training/testing set pair where the hills or valleys have a smooth transition.

(c) Hill_Valley_with_noise_Training.data
(d) Hill_Valley_with_noise_Testing.data
These next two datasets (with noise) are a training/testing set pair where the terrain is uneven, and the hill or valley is not as obvious when viewed closely.
(e) Hill_Valley_sample_arff.text
The sample ARFF file is useful for setting up experiments, but is not necessary.
(f) Hill_Valley_visual_examples.jpg
This graphic file shows two example instances from the data.
