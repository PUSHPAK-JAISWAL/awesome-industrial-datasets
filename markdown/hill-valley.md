# Hill-Valley

**Summary:** Each record represents 100 points on a two-dimensional graph that create either a Hill (a bump) or a Valley (a dip) when plotted in order as the Y coordinate.

## Description

The Hill-Valley dataset contains several files representing hill or valley terrain shapes. There are six files, including two training/testing sets without noise where the hills or valleys have a smooth transition, and two training/testing sets with noise where the terrain is uneven making the hill or valley less obvious. Additionally, a sample ARFF file is provided for setting up experiments, and a graphic showing example instances from the data.

Each record consists of 100 floating point values labeled as "X##" representing coordinates, followed by a binary class label {0, 1} representing valley or hill respectively. The dataset contains 606 instances with 101 features. It is intended for classification tasks, and does not contain missing values.
