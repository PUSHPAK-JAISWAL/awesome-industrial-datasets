## Description

The Smart Manufacturing IoT-Cloud Monitoring Dataset is designed to facilitate real-time process monitoring, predictive maintenance, and anomaly detection in industrial environments. The dataset simulates IoT sensor readings collected from manufacturing machines, including parameters such as temperature, vibration, humidity, pressure, and energy consumption.

It includes anomaly flags, failure types, and a target column (maintenance_required) which indicates whether a machine requires maintenance. Key features include 100,000 sensor records from 50 unique machines with timestamps recorded at 1-minute intervals and machine operational status labels to support machine learning model training for predictive maintenance and anomaly detection.
