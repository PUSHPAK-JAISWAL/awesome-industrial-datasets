## Description

Since the first automobile, the Benz Patent Motor Car in 1886, Mercedes-Benz has stood for important automotive innovations including the passenger safety cell with a crumple zone, the airbag, and intelligent assistance systems. Mercedes-Benz is a leader in the premium car industry, providing customized vehicles with many options.

To ensure safety and reliability, Mercedes-Benz engineers developed a robust testing system for all unique car configurations before release. Optimizing the speed of this testing system, which must handle many feature combinations, is complex and time-consuming without powerful algorithmic solutions.

This dataset contains such combinations of features and aims to facilitate development of algorithms to reduce the time cars spend on the test bench, thereby improving testing efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions without compromising standards.
