## Dataset Information

16 days of continuous operation: 14 under normal operation and 2 days with attack scenarios.
Data from all 123 sensors and actuators.
Attack Scenarios: Derived from the attack models developed by our research team. The attack model considers the intent space of a CPS as an attack model. 15 attacks were launched during the 2 days.
