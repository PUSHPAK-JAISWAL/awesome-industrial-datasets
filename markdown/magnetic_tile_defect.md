## Description

This repository hosts a dataset of magnetic tile images intended for use in training machine learning models. The dataset is designed to facilitate the development of defect detection and classification systems.

The images capture various types of magnetic tiles, some exhibiting defects and others being defect-free. This variety allows for the training of robust models capable of distinguishing between normal and defective tiles.

Due to the limited information provided on the GitHub page, further details regarding the number of images, specific defect types, and acquisition methods are unavailable.
