## Description

This dataset appears to contain data related to a high storage system, with the aim of optimizing energy consumption. It is intended for use in anomaly detection tasks, suggesting that the dataset contains normal operational data as well as instances of anomalies or unusual behavior within the storage system.

Further details regarding the specifics of the data, such as the collection frequency, the nature of the measured parameters, or the exact context of the high storage system, are not provided in the given HTML content.

The anomaly detection focus implies the existence of labeled or potentially label-able anomalies within the dataset, which could be useful for training and evaluating machine learning models.
