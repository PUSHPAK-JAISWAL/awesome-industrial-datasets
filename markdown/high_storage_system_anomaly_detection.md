## Description

The high storage system is a demonstrator located in the Smartfactory in Lemgo, built for research purposes including data-driven energy optimization and anomaly detection using timed automata.

It consists of 4 short conveyor belts and 2 rails, with the middle two belts capable of vertical movement. Each conveyor belt has three induction sensors positioned at specific distances. The system is controlled by a SPS with Codesys V3 which corresponds to IEC61131-Standard. The dataset has four CSV files capturing both normal and anomalous runs, with optimized and non-optimized versions.

These files can be used to evaluate energy optimization processes and anomaly detection models. Anomalies are marked in a 'Label' column. The dataset is public under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license and is supported by research publications provided on the page.
