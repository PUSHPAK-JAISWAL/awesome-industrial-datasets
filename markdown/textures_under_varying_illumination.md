# Textures under varying Illumination

**Summary:** The KTH-TIPS image database provides texture images under varying scale, pose, and illumination, extending the CUReT database by adding new variations and samples.

## Description

The KTH-TIPS (Textures under varying Illumination, Pose and Scale) image database was created to extend the CUReT database in two directions, by providing variations in scale as well as pose and illumination, and by imaging other samples of a subset of its materials in different settings.

The KTH-TIPS2 databases further extended this effort by imaging 4 different samples of 11 materials, each under varying pose, illumination, and scale.

These databases serve as a resource for research in texture classification and material recognition under varying imaging conditions. More information and download options are available on the KTH-TIPS website.
