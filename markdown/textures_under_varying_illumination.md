# Textures under varying Illumination

**Summary:** The KTH-TIPS image database was created to extend the CUReT database in two directions, by providing variations in scale as well as pose and illumination, and by imaging other samples of a subset of its materials in different settings. The KTH-TIPS2 databases took this a step further by imaging 4 different samples of 11 materials, each under varying pose, illumination and scale.

## Description

The KTH-TIPS (Textures under varying Illumination, Pose and Scale) image database was created to extend the CUReT database in two directions, by providing variations in scale as well as pose and illumination, and by imaging other samples of a subset of its materials in different settings.

The KTH-TIPS2 databases took this a step further by imaging 4 different samples of 11 materials, each under varying pose, illumination and scale.

For more information about the databases, please view the documentation. The databases may be downloaded here.
