## Dataset Information

The information gathered is from the DAEWOO Steel Co. Ltd in Gwangyang, South Korea. It produces several types of coils, steel plates, and iron plates. The information on electricity consumption is held in a cloud-based system. The information on energy consumption of the industry is stored on the website of the Korea Electric Power Corporation (pccs.kepco.go.kr), and the perspectives on daily, monthly, and annual data are calculated and shown.
