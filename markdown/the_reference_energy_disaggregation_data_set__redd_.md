# The Reference Energy Disaggregation Data Set (REDD)

**Summary:** The REDD data set provides high frequency (kHz) and low frequency (Hz) power measurements from residential buildings for energy disaggregation research.

## Description

The REDD data set is presented in high frequency (kHz) and low frequency (Hz) groups. High frequency data include current and voltage measurements, while low frequency data cover Power measurement of individual circuits within the houses. The low frequency folder contains six folders, one for each house. Each sub-folder contains a number of channels for different circuits in the house. Labels of each channel which include appliance names are given in a label.dat file in each sub-folder.

The dataset consists of multivariate time series data collected from six residential buildings located in Massachusetts, US. The measurements capture whole home and circuit level power consumption and cover weeks to months duration with sample frequencies ranging from a few Hz to kHz.

The file and directory structure includes a readme.txt file with general information, low frequency power readings (~1Hz) for whole home and circuits, aligned group current/voltage waveforms, and raw current/voltage waveforms for high frequency data groups.
