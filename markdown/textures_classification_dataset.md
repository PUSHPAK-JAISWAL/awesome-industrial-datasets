## Description

This dataset is associated with the paper 'A compact convolutional neural network for surface defect inspection'. It contains textures images, intended for use in surface defect inspection tasks.

The dataset can be used to train and evaluate machine learning models for texture classification and defect detection. Due to the limited information, details regarding the number of images, categories, or specific defect types are not available.

Further details can potentially be found within the linked paper, but aren't readily available on the GitHub repository page.
