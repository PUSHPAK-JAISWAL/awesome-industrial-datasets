## Description

The dataset contains concrete images having cracks. The data is collected from various METU Campus Buildings.

The dataset is divided into two classes: negative and positive crack images for image classification. Each class has 20000 images with a total of 40000 images of size 227 x 227 pixels with RGB channels. The dataset is generated from 458 high-resolution images (4032x3024 pixel) with the method proposed by Zhang et al (2016). High-resolution images have variance in terms of surface finish and illumination conditions. No data augmentation in terms of random rotation or flipping is applied.
