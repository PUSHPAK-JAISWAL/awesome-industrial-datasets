## Description

This dataset comprises a digital database implemented on a VAX station 4000 using INGRES database management system. It contains geological and well data on 2193 wells, approximately 750 of which have detailed core analyses.

The database was developed from a project initiated in 1986 by the Alberta Geological Survey to map the McMurray Formation and the overlying Wabiskaw Member of the Clearwater Formation in the Athabasca Oil Sands Area. The data serves as a significant product to support and facilitate future oil sands development in this region.

The dataset includes various geological attributes such as bitumen, porosity, stratigraphic picks, lithology, water saturation, natural gas, and well log data, among others, making it useful for detailed stratigraphic and resource analysis in oil sands research and exploration.
