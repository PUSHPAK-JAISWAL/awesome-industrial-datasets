## Description

Weld defect identification represents one of the most desired goals in the field of non-destructive testing (NDT) of welds. The dataset consists of images of the TIG welding process in the visible spectrum with improved contrast captured using a high dynamic range (HDR) camera.

This dataset supports research for automated defect classification of Aluminium 5083 TIG welding using artificial neural networks (ANN) for image processing. The images are labeled for various welding imperfections, enabling classification tasks.

It includes a large number of files (33.3k) and represents real welding footage, allowing models to learn to detect welding defects as a task in quality assessment and process monitoring.
