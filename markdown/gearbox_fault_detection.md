## Description

This PHM Data Challenge is focused on fault detection and magnitude estimation for a generic gearbox using accelerometer data and information about bearing geometry. Scoring is based on the ability to correctly identify type, location, and magnitude and damage in a gear system.

The Data Challenge was part of the 2009 Conference of the PHM Society.

The dataset includes data from 560 runs and accelerometer data.
