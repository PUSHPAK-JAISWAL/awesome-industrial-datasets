## Description

As air conditioners are used regularly in homes, they consist of various mechanical components including pistons. These piston components are manufactured worldwide and quality operators traditionally inspect them for quality assurance. This dataset aims to automate the quality recognition process of the piston using AI, potentially replacing human quality operators.

The dataset contains three groups of folders containing images of pistons: Defected 1 (broken, shaped out, fallen pistons), Defected 2 (pistons with oily, grease, or rust stains), and Normal (perfectly normal pistons). The images were collected manually from different components.

Upvoting this dataset motivates the author to collect more unique datasets from the environment. This dataset facilitates machine learning models to perform defect detection and classification in mechanical component images.
