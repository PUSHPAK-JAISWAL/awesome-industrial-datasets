The propulsion system behaviour has been described with this parameters:<br><br>- Ship speed (linear function of the lever position lp). <br>- Compressor degradation coefficient kMc. <br>- Turbine degradation coefficient kMt. <br><br>so that each possible degradation state can be described by a combination of this triple (lp,kMt,kMc). <br><br>The range of decay of compressor and turbine has been sampled with an uniform grid of precision 0.001 so to have a good granularity of representation. In particular for the compressor decay state discretization the kMc coefficient has been investigated in the domain [1; 0.95], and the turbine coefficient in the domain [1; 0.975]. Ship speed has been investigated sampling the range of feasible speed from 3 knots to 27 knots with a granularity of representation equal to three knots. <br><br>A series of measures (16 features) which indirectly represents of the state of the system subject to performance decay has been acquired and stored in the dataset over the parameter's space. <br><br>Ship speed has been investigated sampling the range of feasible speed from 3 knots to 27 knots with a granularity of representation equal to three knots.<br><br>A series of measures (16 features) which indirectly represents of the state of the system subject to performance decay has been acquired and stored in the dataset over the parameter's space.</p><h2>Attribute Information</h2><p>A 16-feature vector containing the GT measures at steady state of the physical asset:   <br><br>1 - Lever position (lp) [ ]  <br>2 - Ship speed (v) [knots]   <br>3 - Gas Turbine shaft torque (GTT) [kN m]  <br>4 - Gas Turbine rate of revolutions (GTn) [rpm]  <br>5 - Gas Generator rate of revolutions (GGn) [rpm]  <br>6 - Starboard Propeller Torque (Ts) [kN]  <br>7 - Port Propeller Torque (Tp) [kN]  <br>8 - HP Turbine exit temperature (T48) [C]  <br>9 - GT Compressor inlet air temperature (T1) [C]  <br>10 - GT Compressor outlet air temperature (T2) [C]  <br>11 - HP Turbine exit pressure (P48) [bar]  <br>12 - GT Compressor inlet air pressure (P1) [bar]  <br>13 - GT Compressor outlet air pressure (P2) [bar]  <br>14 - Gas Turbine exhaust gas pressure (Pexh) [bar]  <br>15 - Turbine Injecton Control (TIC) [%]  <br>16 - Fuel flow (mf) [kg/s]  <br><br>17 - GT Compressor decay state coefficient.
