Parameters such as film thickness and stretch are monitored by sensors, but defects are observed only visually by the operator, and not always in real time (there is a practice of determining the time of a defect by the length of the film and bookmark markers). Production technologists attribute these defects to several factors, including equipment malfunction and poor quality of incoming raw materials.</p><p>The most important type of defect is film breakage, and it is what the customer asks to minimize. It occurs for various reasons, some of a mechanical nature, for example, a speck that fell into the “head” of the extruder. Some are due to other types of defects; The 3 most common are holes on the canvas, non-melting of raw granules and the output of scale. At present, there is no practice of observing these defects on the installation data; laboratory tests of samples are the maximum. Such defects do not necessarily lead to cliffs.</p><h2>Tags</h2><ul><li>Film breakage</li><li>Manufacturing defect detection</li><li>Multivariate data</li><li>Plastic extrusion</li><li>Process parameters</li><li>Time-series sensor data</li><li>Visual defect inspection</li></ul><h2>References</h2><ul><li><a href='https://www.kaggle.com/podsyp/find-a-defect-in-the-production-extrusion-line/metadata'>Plastic Extrusion Defects Dataset on Kaggle</a></li></ul><a href="../../index.html" class="btn btn-primary mt-4">Back to Index</a></div>
