    <p>The SWaT dataset represents a scaled-down but high-fidelity replica of a modern six-stage water treatment facility that processes approximately 19 litres of water per minute and contains both normal operational data and records of various cyber-physical attacks.</p><table class="table table-striped mt-4"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Associated Tasks</strong></td><td>Anomaly Detection, Classification</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Data Source</strong></td><td>Real</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dataset Characteristics</strong></td><td>Multivariate, Time-Series, Cyber-Physical Systems</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date Donated</strong></td><td>Information not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Feature Type</strong></td><td>Real</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Labeled</strong></td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Missing Values</strong></td><td>Information not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Name</strong></td><td>Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) Dataset</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Number of Features</strong></td><td>51 sensors and actuators</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Number of Instances</strong></td><td>Information not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Source</strong></td><td>iTrust, Centre for Research in Cyber Security, Singapore University of Technology and Design</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Time Series</strong></td><td>Yes</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Description</h2><p>The Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) dataset was collected from an operational water treatment testbed over 11 days, consisting of 7 days under normal operation and 4 days with multiple cyber-physical attack scenarios. It contains network traffic and sensor/actuator values, with data labelled according to normal and abnormal behaviors. Attack scenarios are derived from the intent space of a cyber-physical system with 41 attacks launched during the four days.</p><p>The dataset provides a time series of 51 sensors and actuators data collected continuously, serving as a benchmark for anomaly detection in industrial control systems and cybersecurity research. Updates to the dataset include different versions with attack data and normal operating conditions, with data collected at different times from 2015 to 2020, including network traffic (pcap files) and historian data.</p><p>Researchers use this dataset for developing machine learning approaches to detect anomalies, including convolutional and recurrent neural networks, leveraging advanced deep learning techniques to secure critical infrastructure like water treatment facilities.</p><h2>Tags</h2><ul><li>Anomaly Detection</li><li>Cyber-Physical Systems</li><li>Cybersecurity</li><li>Industrial Control Systems</li><li>Sensor Data</li><li>Time-Series Data</li><li>Water Treatment</li></ul><h2>References</h2><ul><li><a href='https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305809559_A_Dataset_to_Support_Research_in_the_Design_of_Secure_Water_Treatment_Systems'>A Dataset to Support Research in the Design of Secure Water Treatment Systems</a></li><li><a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7469060'>SWaT: a water treatment testbed for research and training on ICS security</a></li><li><a href='https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs_datasets/'>iTrust Datasets Page</a></li></ul><a href="../../index.html" class="btn btn-primary mt-4">Back to Index</a></div>
