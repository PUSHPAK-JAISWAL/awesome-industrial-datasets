The dataset records data collected from all 123 sensors and actuators in the system. The attack scenarios are derived from attack models developed by the research team at iTrust, considering the intent space of a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) as an attack model. During the 2 days of attacks, a total of 15 attacks were launched.</p><p>The dataset was updated on 19 Dec 2019 (WADI.A2) to remove data affected during unstable plant operation periods and includes a corrected CSV file and label data indicating the presence or absence of attacks. This dataset is useful for research in designing secure cyber-physical systems, especially in anomaly detection and attack detection in critical infrastructure.</p><p>Researchers and practitioners are required to credit iTrust, Centre for Research in Cyber Security, Singapore University of Technology and Design when using the dataset in published works. Access to the dataset is controlled and requires requesting permission from iTrust.</p><h2>Tags</h2><ul><li>Anomaly detection</li><li>Attack scenarios</li><li>Critical infrastructure</li><li>Cyber-Physical Systems</li><li>Sensor data</li><li>Time-series data</li><li>Water distribution</li></ul><h2>References</h2><ul><li><a href='https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3055366.3055375'>WaDi: a water distribution testbed for research in the design of secure cyber physical systems</a></li><li><a href='https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs_datasets/dataset_info/'>iTrust Labs Dataset Information</a></li></ul><a href="../../index.html" class="btn btn-primary mt-4">Back to Index</a></div>
