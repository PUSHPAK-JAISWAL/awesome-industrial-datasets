Two gas mixtures were generated: Ethylene and Methane in air, and Ethylene and CO in air. Each measurement was constructed by the continuous acquisition of the 16-sensor array signals for about 12 hours without interruption.</p><p>The data set was collected at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. The sensor array consisted of 16 chemical sensors of 4 different types (TGS-2600, TGS-2602, TGS-2610, TGS-2620), with sensors integrated with customized signal conditioning and control electronics. Sensor conductivities were acquired continuously at 100 Hz sampling frequency within a 60 ml measurement chamber with a constant gas flow.</p><p>Concentration transitions were set randomly to simulate varying gas levels with all possible transitions included. Concentration ranges were chosen to induce similar sensor response magnitudes for Ethylene (0-20 ppm), CO (0-600 ppm), and Methane (0-300 ppm). The dataset aims to aid development of methods for continuous monitoring, sensor variability studies, sensor failure analysis, and calibration transfer research.</p><h2>Tags</h2><ul><li>Artificial intelligence research</li><li>Chemical sensors</li><li>Continuous acquisition</li><li>Gas mixture analysis</li><li>Multivariate sensor data</li><li>Sensor array</li><li>Time series data</li></ul><h2>References</h2><ul><li><a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+sensor+array+under+dynamic+gas+mixtures'>UCI Machine Learning Repository</a></li><li><a href='https://doi.org/10.24432/C5WP4C'>Dataset DOI</a></li><li><a href='https://doi.org/10.24432/C5WP4C'>Citation: Fonollosa, J.
