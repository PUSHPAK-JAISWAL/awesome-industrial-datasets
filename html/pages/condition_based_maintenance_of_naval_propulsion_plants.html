    <h2>Dataset Information</h2><p>The experiments have been carried out by means of a numerical simulator of a naval vessel (Frigate) characterized by a Gas Turbine (GT) propulsion plant. The different blocks forming the complete simulator (Propeller, Hull, GT, Gear Box and Controller) have been developed and fine-tuned over the year on several similar real propulsion plants. In view of these observations, the available data are in agreement with a possible real vessel.<br>In this release of the simulator, it is also possible to take into account the performance decay over time of the GT components such as GT compressor and turbines.<br>The propulsion system behaviour has been described with these parameters:<br>- Ship speed (linear function of the lever position lp).<br>- Compressor degradation coefficient kMc.<br>- Turbine degradation coefficient kMt.<br>so that each possible degradation state can be described by a combination of this triple (lp,kMt,kMc).<br>The range of decay of compressor and turbine has been sampled with a uniform grid of precision 0.001 so to have a good granularity of representation.<br>In particular for the compressor decay state discretization, the kMc coefficient has been investigated in the domain [1; 0.95], and the turbine coefficient in the domain [1; 0.975].<br>Ship speed has been investigated by sampling the range of feasible speeds from 3 knots to 27 knots with a granularity of representation equal to three knots.<br>A series of measures (16 features) which indirectly represents the state of the system subject to performance decay has been acquired and stored in the dataset over the parameter's space.<br>Check the README.txt file for further details about this dataset.</p><h2>Tags</h2><ul><li>Naval propulsion</li><li>Condition-based maintenance</li><li>Gas turbine</li><li>Simulation data</li><li>Performance decay</li></ul><h2>References</h2><ul><li><a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Condition+Based+Maintenance+of+Naval+Propulsion+Plants#'>UCI Machine Learning Repository</a></li></ul>
