It supports the 3W Project, which aims to promote experimentation and development of Machine Learning-based approaches and algorithms for specific problems related to detection and classification of undesirable events that occur in offshore oil wells.</p><p>The 3W Project is based on the 3W Dataset, a database described in a research paper, and on the 3W Toolkit, a software package that promotes experimentation with the 3W Dataset for specific problems. The name 3W was chosen because this dataset is composed of instances from 3 different sources and contains undesirable events that occur in oil wells.</p><p>Timely detection of undesirable events in oil wells can help prevent production losses, reduce maintenance costs, environmental accidents, and human casualties. Losses related to this type of events can reach 5% of production in certain scenarios, especially in areas such as Flow Assurance and Artificial Lifting Methods. In terms of maintenance, the cost of a maritime probe, required to perform various types of operations, can exceed US $500,000 per day.</p><h2>Tags</h2><ul><li>Fault detection</li><li>Multivariate data</li><li>Oil and Gas</li><li>Oil wells</li><li>Real events</li><li>Sensor data</li><li>Time-series analysis</li></ul><h2>References</h2><ul><li><a href='https://github.com/petrobras/3W/'>GitHub</a></li></ul><a href="../../index.html" class="btn btn-primary mt-4">Back to Index</a></div>
