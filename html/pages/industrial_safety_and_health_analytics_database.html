    <h2>Dataset Information</h2><p>It is not always easy to find databases from real-world manufacturing plants So, I would like to share this database with the community, which comes from one of the biggest industry in Brazil and in the world.<br>The primary reason why we are sharing this data is that there is an urgent need for companies to understand why employees still suffer some injuries/accidents in plants. Sometimes they also die in such environment. So hope the community help us to explore and take better/newer insights from this data.</p><h2>Content</h2><p>The database is basically records of accidents from 12 different plants in 03 different countries where every line in the data is an occurrence of an accident.<br><br>Columns description<br>Data: timestamp or time/date information<br>Countries: which country the accident occurred (anonymized)<br>Local: the city where the manufacturing plant is located (anonymized)<br>Industry sector: which sector the plant belongs to<br>Accident level: from I to VI, it registers how severe was the accident (I means not severe but VI means very severe)<br>Potential Accident Level: Depending on the Accident Level, the database also registers how severe the accident could have been (due to other factors involved in the accident)<br>Genre: if the person is male or female<br>Employee or Third Party: if the injured person is an employee or a third party<br>Critical Risk: some description of the risk involved in the accident<br>Description: Detailed description of how the accident happened.</p><h2>Tags</h2><ul><li>Workplace safety</li><li>Health and safety</li><li>Accident reports</li><li>Risk management</li></ul><h2>References</h2><ul><li><a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ihmstefanini/industrial-safety-and-health-analytics-database'>Kaggle Dataset</a></li></ul>
