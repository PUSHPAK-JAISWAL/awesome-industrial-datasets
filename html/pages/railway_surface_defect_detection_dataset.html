This dataset comprises two subsets: Type-I RSDDs and Type-II RSDDs, which were collected from express and common/heavy haul railways, respectively.</p><p>Type-I RSDDs consists of 67 images, each measuring 160×1000 pixels, while Type-II RSDDs includes 128 images, each measuring 55×1250 pixels. These images were captured under various lighting conditions to simulate real-world railway manufacturing and maintenance environments. Each image has been meticulously annotated by professionals, ensuring the accuracy of defect detection.</p><p>The RSDDs dataset is designed to support the development and evaluation of deep learning models for the automatic identification and classification of various defects on railway surfaces, such as cracks, pores, and wear. The dataset contains complex backgrounds and substantial noise and is valuable for automating inspection and maintenance in the railway industry.</p><h2>Tags</h2><ul><li>Computer vision</li><li>Deep learning</li><li>Image dataset</li><li>Image defects</li><li>Industrial maintenance</li><li>Railway inspection</li><li>Surface defect detection</li></ul><h2>References</h2><ul><li><a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/qtv6-n081'>IEEE DataPort</a></li><li><a href='https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/rsdds'>IEEE DataPort Dataset Page</a></li></ul><a href="../../index.html" class="btn btn-primary mt-4">Back to Index</a></div>
