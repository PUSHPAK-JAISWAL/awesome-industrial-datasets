    <h2>Dataset Information</h2><p>Date_Time: Timestamp indicating when the energy consumption data was recorded.<br><br>Usage_kWh: Energy usage in kilowatt-hours (kWh), representing the amount of electricity consumed during a specific period, likely related to steel production processes or facility operations.<br><br>Lagging_Current_Reactive.Power_kVarh: Reactive power consumption in kilovolt-amperes reactive hour (kVarh). Reactive power is essential in steel industry equipment for tasks such as magnetization and induction heating.<br><br>Leading_Current_Reactive_Power_kVarh: Similar to lagging current reactive power but likely refers to leading reactive power consumption, which can occur in capacitive loads.<br><br>CO2(tCO2): Carbon dioxide emissions in metric tons of CO2. This could indicate the environmental impact of energy consumption in steel production, as CO2 emissions are a concern in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.<br><br>Lagging_Current_Power_Factor: Power factor measures the efficiency of electrical power usage. A lagging power factor indicates inefficient use of electricity, which could signify inefficiencies in certain steel production processes or equipment.<br><br>Leading_Current_Power_Factor: Similar to lagging power factor but likely refers to leading power factor, which indicates more efficient use of electricity.<br><br>NSM (Normalized Solar Energy): This could be a derived feature representing solar energy normalized against some baseline. It might indicate the integration of renewable energy sources like solar power into the steel production process or facility operations.<br><br>WeekStatus: Indicates whether the data corresponds to a weekday or a weekend. This could be useful for analyzing energy consumption patterns based on the day of the week.<br><br>Day_Of_Week: Indicates the day of the week when the data was recorded, providing further granularity for analyzing energy consumption patterns over weekdays.</p><h2>Tags</h2><ul><li>Steel production</li><li>Energy consumption</li><li>Manufacturing process</li><li>Industrial data</li><li>Operational efficiency</li></ul><h2>References</h2><ul><li><a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayushparwal2026/steel-industry-datasets'>Kaggle Dataset</a></li></ul>
