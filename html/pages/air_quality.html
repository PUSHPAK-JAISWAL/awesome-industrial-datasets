The device was located on the field in a significantly polluted area, at road level, within an Italian city. Data were recorded from March 2004 to February 2005 (one year) representing the longest freely available recordings of on field deployed air quality chemical sensor devices responses.</p><p>Ground Truth hourly averaged concentrations for CO, Non Metanic Hydrocarbons, Benzene, Total Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) were provided by a co-located reference certified analyzer. Evidences of cross-sensitivities as well as both concept and sensor drifts are present as described in De Vito et al., Sens. And Act. B, Vol. 129,2,2008 (citation required) eventually affecting sensors concentration estimation capabilities. Missing values are tagged with -200 value.</p><p>This dataset can be used exclusively for research purposes. Commercial purposes are fully excluded.</p><h2>Tags</h2><ul><li>Air quality monitoring</li><li>Chemical sensors</li><li>Gas concentration</li><li>Italian city data</li><li>Metal oxide sensors</li><li>Pollution measurement</li><li>Time series data</li></ul><h2>References</h2><ul><li><a href='https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a90a54a39ff934772df57771a0012981f355949d'>On field calibration of an electronic nose for benzene estimation in an urban pollution monitoring scenario</a></li><li><a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality'>UCI Machine Learning Repository</a></li><li><a href='https://doi.org/10.24432/C59K5F'>Dataset DOI</a></li></ul><a href="../../index.html" class="btn btn-primary mt-4">Back to Index</a></div>
