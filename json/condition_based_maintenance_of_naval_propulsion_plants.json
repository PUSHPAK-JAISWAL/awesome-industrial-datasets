            "Content": "The experiments have been carried out by means of a numerical simulator of a naval vessel (Frigate) characterized by a Gas Turbine (GT) propulsion plant. The different blocks forming the complete simulator (Propeller, Hull, GT, Gear Box and Controller) have been developed and fine-tuned over the year on several similar real propulsion plants. In view of these observations, the available data are in agreement with a possible real vessel.\nIn this release of the simulator, it is also possible to take into account the performance decay over time of the GT components such as GT compressor and turbines.\nThe propulsion system behaviour has been described with these parameters:\n- Ship speed (linear function of the lever position lp).\n- Compressor degradation coefficient kMc.\n- Turbine degradation coefficient kMt.\nso that each possible degradation state can be described by a combination of this triple (lp,kMt,kMc).\nThe range of decay of compressor and turbine has been sampled with a uniform grid of precision 0.001 so to have a good granularity of representation.\nIn particular for the compressor decay state discretization, the kMc coefficient has been investigated in the domain [1; 0.95], and the turbine coefficient in the domain [1; 0.975].\nShip speed has been investigated by sampling the range of feasible speeds from 3 knots to 27 knots with a granularity of representation equal to three knots.\nA series of measures (16 features) which indirectly represents the state of the system subject to performance decay has been acquired and stored in the dataset over the parameter's space.\nCheck the README.txt file for further details about this dataset."
