Each record represents various metrics crucial for predicting high or low defect occurrences in production processes.\nThe dataset focuses on defect instances more because they do not occur often. However, non-defect instances were added too for this reason the dataset is imbalanced, consider balancing it before proceeding with machine learning techniques."
