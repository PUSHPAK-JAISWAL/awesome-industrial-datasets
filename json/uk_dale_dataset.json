            "Content": "This dataset records the power demand from five houses. In each house, we record both the whole-house mains power demand every six seconds as well as power demand from individual appliances every six seconds. In three of the five houses (houses 1, 2, and 5) we also record the whole-house voltage and current at 16 kHz.\n\nTo download the disaggregated data as ZIPPED CSV files, please download ukdale.zip from the UKERC EDC. It's 3.5 GBytes in size so will take a while to download! For other formats, please keep reading...\n\nEach release of the dataset is labelled with the month and year. The most recent (and final) release is for April 2017. UK-DALE now includes 4.3 years of data for house 1."
