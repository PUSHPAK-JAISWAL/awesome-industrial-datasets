  "Summary": "This dataset provides additional simulation data from the Tennessee Eastman Process designed for evaluating anomaly detection methods.",
  "Description": "This dataset contains additional simulation data generated using the Tennessee Eastman Process, a widely used benchmark in process control and fault detection research. It is aimed at evaluating anomaly detection approaches by providing a comprehensive set of simulated faults.\n\nThe data includes multiple types of fault scenarios and normal operational data, reflecting a complex industrial chemical process. The Tennessee Eastman Process simulation is synthetic but based on realistic industrial process dynamics. This dataset serves as a benchmark to compare different anomaly detection algorithms and improve their performance.\n\nResearchers can utilize this dataset to develop and test machine learning models designed to detect and classify process anomalies accurately. It supports efforts in predictive maintenance and fault diagnosis in industrial settings.",
