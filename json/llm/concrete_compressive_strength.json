  "Description": "Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients.\n\nThe dataset contains 1030 instances and 9 attributes in total, including 8 quantitative input variables and 1 quantitative output variable representing the concrete compressive strength. There are no missing attribute values in this dataset.\n\nThe input variables represent the quantities (kg/m3) of components including Cement, Blast Furnace Slag, Fly Ash, Water, Superplasticizer, Coarse Aggregate, Fine Aggregate, and Age (in days). The output variable is the concrete compressive strength measured in MPa.",
