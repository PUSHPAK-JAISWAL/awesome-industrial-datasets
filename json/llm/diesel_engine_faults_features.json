  "Summary": "The objective of this dataset is the fault diagnosis in diesel engines to assist predictive maintenance through analysis of pressure curves and torsional vibration responses.",
  "Description": "The dataset was developed for fault diagnosis in diesel engines to assist predictive maintenance by analyzing variations in pressure curves inside cylinders and torsional vibration response of the crankshaft. A fault simulation model based on a zero-dimensional thermodynamic model was developed to generate the data.\n\nFeature vectors were chosen from the thermodynamic model and processed signals such as pressure and temperature inside the cylinder, and torsional vibration of the engine\u2019s flywheel. These vectors serve as input for machine learning techniques to discriminate among several machine conditions.\n\nThe dataset comprises 3500 different fault scenarios covering four distinct operational conditions \u2014 Normal, Pressure reduction in the intake manifold, Compression ratio reduction in the cylinders, and Reduction of amount of fuel injected into the cylinders. The feature vector consists of 84 columns representing pressure and vibration features, with 3500 rows of samples.",
