  "Summary": "The ECO data set is a comprehensive dataset for non-intrusive load monitoring and occupancy detection research. It was collected in 6 Swiss households over a period of 8 months.",
  "Description": "The ECO data set provides access to electricity consumption and occupancy data collected in 6 Swiss households over 8 months. The dataset includes 1 Hz aggregate consumption data (current, voltage, and phase shift for each of the three phases), 1 Hz plug-level data from selected appliances, and occupancy information measured through a tablet computer (manual labeling) and passive infrared sensors. \n\nThe data was collected as part of the Smart Meter Services project and is related to the NILM-Eval framework. The ECO dataset has been used to evaluate non-intrusive load monitoring algorithms and for opportunistic occupancy sensing.\n\nThe dataset may be obtained from http://data-archive.ethz.ch/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=IE594964 or via its own DOI.",
