  "Summary": "The datasets contain raw and processed data collected from an oil and gas company, and an artificial dataset for oscillation detection based on Machine Learning.",
  "Description": "The page provides access to industrial datasets related to control loops. These datasets include:\n\nSISO-RAW: Raw data collected in two and a half days from an oil and gas company with non-constant sampling time.\n\nSISO-SEL: Selected fragments from the SISO-RAW dataset.\n\nSISO-SAMP: Constant sampling time from the SISO-SEL dataset. \n\nThere is also an oscillation detection artificial dataset (ODADS) used by the authors\u2019 previous work on a technique for oscillation detection based on Machine Learning.",
