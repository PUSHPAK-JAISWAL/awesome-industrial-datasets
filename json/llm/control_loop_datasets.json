  "Summary": "Datasets collected from industrial control loops including raw, selected, and sampled data from an oil and gas company, along with an oscillation detection artificial dataset used for machine learning.",
  "Description": "The Control loop datasets include several industrial datasets:\n\n- SISO-RAW: Raw data collected over two and a half days from an oil and gas company with non-constant sampling time.\n- SISO-SEL: Selected fragments derived from the SISO-RAW dataset.\n- SISO-SAMP: Data with constant sampling time based on the SISO-SEL dataset.\n\nAdditionally, there is the Oscillation Detection Artificial Dataset (ODADS), which was used in previous work by the authors on a technique for oscillation detection based on machine learning. The datasets support research in control, modeling, simulation, and optimization of industrial processes.",
