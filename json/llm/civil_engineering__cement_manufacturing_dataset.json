  "Summary": "The dataset contains concrete compressive strength data along with ingredient proportions and age for cement manufacturing.",
  "Description": "The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under a specific age (days) was determined from laboratory. Data is in raw form (not scaled). The data has 8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output variable, and 1030 instances (observations).\n\nConcrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.\n\nThe attribute information includes cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate in kg in a m3 mixture, and age in days (1 to 365). The output variable is the concrete compressive strength measured in MPa.",
