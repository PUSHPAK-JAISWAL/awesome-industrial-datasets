  "Description": "GREEND is an energy dataset containing power measurements collected from multiple households in Austria and Italy. It provides detailed energy profiles on a per device basis with a sampling rate of 1 Hz.\n\nThe dataset is expected to have regular snapshots as more data is recorded and measurement platforms are deployed.\n\nThe GREEND dataset is free to use in research and commercial applications. Access to the dataset is provided after filling a brief form to obtain credentials for the dataset archive. It is important to cite the original work when relying on this dataset in research.",
