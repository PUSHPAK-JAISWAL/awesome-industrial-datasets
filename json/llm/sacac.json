  "Summary": "An industrial data repository contributed by industrial control practitioners and academic researchers, aimed at providing test environments for control loop performance monitoring methods.",
  "Description": "The SACAC data repository contains industrial process data contributed by industry practitioners and academic researchers working closely with industry. Its primary aim is to provide a test environment for control loop performance monitoring methods used in process industries, particularly focusing on single-input-single-output PID control loops which often perform poorly.\n\nThe datasets are categorized according to the causes of poor control loop performance, based on the classification described by Bauer et al. (2016), ordered by the frequency of occurrence in industrial processes. The repository is described in scientific papers and seeks to foster the development and comparison of methods to detect and diagnose poorly performing control loops.\n\nThe repository includes multiple categories of datasets covering phenomena like stiction, sensor faults, quantization, and saturation among others. Researchers and practitioners are encouraged to contribute data and use the repository for academic and practical studies in control loop performance monitoring.",
