  "Description": "The data is contributed by industrial control practitioners as well as by academic researchers who work closely with industry. The aim of this repository is to provide a test environment for control loop performance monitoring methods.\u00a0\n\nThe data sets are arranged according to the cause of the poor performance of the control loops. These categories are described in\u00a0Bauer et al. (2016)\u00a0and are ordered according to how often they occur in industrial processes.\n\nFor any\u00a0queries\u00a0or if you would like to\u00a0contribute industrial process data\u00a0please send us an email at:\u00a0piddata@sacac.org.za",
