  "Description": "The WM811K dataset is used for wafer map classification tasks. It has been utilized in several papers published by the MIR lab, including the work by Ming-Ju Wu, Jyh-Shing Roger Jang, and Jui-Long Chen on wafer map failure pattern recognition and similarity ranking for large-scale datasets.\n\nThis dataset supports research in semiconductor manufacturing fault diagnosis by providing large-scale wafer map data for pattern recognition. The MIR Lab provides this dataset for public download to foster research in this domain.\n\nIt is suitable for machine learning tasks related to classification of wafer defects and patterns in semiconductor manufacturing data.",
