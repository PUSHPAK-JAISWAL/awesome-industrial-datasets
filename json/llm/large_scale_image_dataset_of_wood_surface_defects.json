  "Description": "This dataset is a subset of \"A large-scale image dataset of wood surface defects for automated vision-based quality control processes\". It contains 4,000 images annotated with 8 different types of wood surface defects including Quartzity, Live_Knot, Marrow, resin, Dead_Knot, knot_with_crack, Knot_missing, and Crack.\n\nThe original dataset consisted of high-resolution images captured with a special camera, each image taking about 12 MB of disk space. This version resizes the images to 2800x1024 resolution, reducing the disk space requirement to approximately 1 MB per image while adjusting annotations accordingly. The annotations have been converted into YOLOv5 format to facilitate use in object detection tasks.\n\nThis dataset is designed to support automated vision-based quality control processes in wood surface defect detection and classification, providing a valuable resource for machine learning applications in the forestry and manufacturing industries.",
