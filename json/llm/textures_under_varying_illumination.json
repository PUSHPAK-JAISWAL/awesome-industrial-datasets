  "Summary": "The KTH-TIPS image database was created to extend the CUReT database in two directions, by providing variations in scale as well as pose and illumination, and by imaging other samples of a subset of its materials in different settings. The KTH-TIPS2 databases took this a step further by imaging 4 different samples of 11 materials, each under varying pose, illumination and scale.",
