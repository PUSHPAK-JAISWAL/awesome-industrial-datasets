  "Description": "MVTec AD is a dataset for benchmarking anomaly detection methods with a focus on industrial inspection. It contains over 5000 high-resolution images divided into fifteen different object and texture categories. Each category comprises a set of defect-free training images and a test set of images with various kinds of defects as well as images without defects.\n\nPixel-precise annotations of all anomalies are also provided. More information can be in our paper \"MVTec AD \u2013 A Comprehensive Real-World Dataset for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection\" and its extended version \"The MVTec Anomaly Detection Dataset: A Comprehensive Real-World Dataset for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection\".\n\nThe data is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0). In particular, it is not allowed to use the dataset for commercial purposes.",
