  "Summary": "Solar power generation and sensor data collected from two power plants in India over a 34 day period.",
  "Description": "This dataset consists of solar power generation data and sensor readings from two solar power plants in India. The data was gathered over a 34 day period. The power generation data is collected at the inverter level, where each inverter has multiple lines of solar panels connected to it. The sensor data is gathered at the plant level, using a single array of sensors optimally placed at the plant.\n\nThe dataset contains two pairs of files\u2014each pair includes one power generation dataset and one sensor readings dataset for each plant. The dataset can be used to predict power generation for the upcoming days, which supports better grid management. It can also be used to identify the need for panel cleaning or maintenance and to detect faulty or suboptimally performing equipment.\n\nThe data has a usability score of 10.0 on Kaggle and includes 26 columns. The dataset is well-formatted, with records taken at 15-minute intervals, and includes detailed measurements like DC power, AC power, daily yield, and total yield among others.",
