  "Description": "The Kylberg Texture Dataset consists of 28 texture classes, each containing 160 unique texture patches of 576\u00d7576 pixels in size. There is an alternative dataset version including 12 rotations per each original patch, resulting in 1920 texture patches per class. All patches are stored in lossless compressed 8-bit PNG format and normalized with a mean value of 127 and a standard deviation of 40. Files are organized in one directory per texture class and follow a specific naming convention indicating the class name, image sample number, patch number, and rotation.\n\nThis dataset was acquired and published during Gustaf Kylberg's Ph.D. studies at Uppsala University. It was created to serve as a benchmark for texture classification tasks in computer vision and image analysis. The original images used for generating texture patches, as well as the untouched RAW originals from the camera, are also available. Detailed documentation in PDF format is provided for further information.\n\nThe dataset supports research and experimentation in texture analysis and classification, providing high-quality real texture images. A smaller subset with 6 classes and 40 samples each is also available for quicker experimentation or testing.",
