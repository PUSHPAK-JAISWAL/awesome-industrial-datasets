  "Summary": "This dataset is collected from a monitor system mounted in a domotic house. It corresponds to approximately 40 days of monitoring data.",
  "Description": "The dataset could contain missing values. The data was sampled every minute, computing and uploading it smoothed with 15 minute means. The header of the data file is a commentary (begins with #) indicating which data is stored at which column (in Spanish). The data is time information is in UTC.\n\nThe attributes recorded are: Date and Time in UTC; Indoor temperatures (dinning-room and room) in \u00b0C; Weather forecast temperature in \u00b0C; Carbon dioxide concentration in ppm (dinning room and room); Relative humidity in % (dinning room and room); Lighting in Lux (dinning room and room); Rain proportion over the last 15 minutes; Sun dusk; Wind speed in m/s; Sun light on various facades in Lux; Sun irradiance in W/m2; States of three enthalpic motors (on-off); Outdoor temperature in \u00b0C; Outdoor relative humidity in %; Day of the week (1=Monday, 7=Sunday).\n\nThis dataset is a valuable resource for studying environmental monitoring in smart homes and domotic systems, enabling the development of regression models and time-series analyses relating to indoor and outdoor environmental conditions and their interrelations.",
