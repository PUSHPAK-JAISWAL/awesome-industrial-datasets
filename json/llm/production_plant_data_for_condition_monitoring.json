  "Summary": "The dataset focuses on the prediction of the condition of an important component within production lines, based on data from 8 run-to-failure experiments and 8 features related to the component.",
  "Description": "This dataset was used in previous research projects, including the IMPROVE project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 program. \n\nThe use case addresses the prediction of the condition of a critical component in production lines, which affects both plant functioning and product quality. The dataset contains data from 8 run-to-failure experiments and features related to the component. Training and prediction were performed using a leave-one-out method whereby data from the component under test served as the prediction target, and data from other components served as training data to represent the 'new' condition. A Self-Organizing Map (SOM) was trained on the training data to model the 'new' condition and to visualize degradation.\n\nThe prediction was successful in identifying wear types labeled by experts, and correctly identified a component without wear signs as confirmed by expert assessment.
