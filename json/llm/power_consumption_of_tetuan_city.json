  "Description": "This dataset contains power consumption data from three different distribution networks in Tetouan city, located in north Morocco.\n\nThe data includes weather variables such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed along with power consumption for each of the three zones. Each record corresponds to a time interval of ten minutes.\n\nThe dataset is suitable for regression tasks and analysis related to power consumption prediction considering environmental factors. It contains no missing values and comprises both real and integer data types.",
