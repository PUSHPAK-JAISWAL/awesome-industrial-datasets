  "Description": "This PHM Data Challenge is focused on fault detection and magnitude estimation for a generic gearbox using accelerometer data and information about bearing geometry. Scoring is based on the ability to correctly identify type, location, and magnitude and damage in a gear system.\n\nThe Data Challenge was part of the 2009 Conference of the PHM Society.\n\nThe dataset includes data from 560 runs, with supporting readme and video files to aid understanding of the gearbox system and recorded faults.",
