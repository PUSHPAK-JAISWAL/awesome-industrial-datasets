  "Description": "The Railway Surface Defect Detection (RSDDs) dataset enhances the safety and reliability of railway transportation. This dataset includes two subsets: Type-I RSDDs and Type-II RSDDs, collected from express and common/heavy haul railways, respectively. Type-I RSDDs consists of 67 images, each measuring 160\u00d71000 pixels, while Type-II RSDDs includes 128 images, each measuring 55\u00d71250 pixels.\n\nThese images were captured under various lighting conditions to simulate real-world railway manufacturing and maintenance environments. Each image has been meticulously annotated by professionals, ensuring the accuracy of defect detection. \n\nThe RSDDs dataset supports the development and evaluation of deep learning models for the automatic identification and classification of various defects on railway surfaces, such as cracks, pores, and wear. This dataset holds significant practical value for the automation of inspection and maintenance in the railway industry.",
