  "Description": "The Railway Surface Defect Detection (RSDDs) dataset was created to enhance the safety and reliability of railway transportation. This dataset comprises two subsets: Type-I RSDDs and Type-II RSDDs, which were collected from express and common/heavy haul railways, respectively.\n\nType-I RSDDs consists of 67 images, each measuring 160\u00d71000 pixels, while Type-II RSDDs includes 128 images, each measuring 55\u00d71250 pixels. These images were captured under various lighting conditions to simulate real-world railway manufacturing and maintenance environments. Each image has been meticulously annotated by professionals, ensuring the accuracy of defect detection.\n\nThe RSDDs dataset is designed to support the development and evaluation of deep learning models for the automatic identification and classification of various defects on railway surfaces, such as cracks, pores, and wear. The dataset contains complex backgrounds and substantial noise and is valuable for automating inspection and maintenance in the railway industry.",
