  "Summary": "This Data Package contains a list of renewable energy power plants from several European countries, along with daily time series of cumulated installed capacity per energy source type for selected countries.",
  "Description": "This data package includes renewable energy power plant listings from Czechia, Denmark, France, Germany, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The dataset comprises individual power plants and aggregated data by region or municipality depending on the country, with varying levels of detail and accuracy.\n\nThe energy sources represented include solar, hydro, wind, bioenergy, marine, and geothermal among others. Entries suspected to be duplicates or questionable are marked in a special comment column detailed in a separate validation marker file. Additionally, the dataset provides daily time series data of cumulated installed capacity per energy source for Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Sweden.\n\nThe data is compiled from the Open Power System Data platform and is available as separate CSV files per country, facilitating comprehensive analysis of renewable power infrastructure across multiple European regions.",
