  "Summary": "A dataset of functional and defective solar cells extracted from EL images of solar modules.",
  "Description": "This dataset contains images of both functional and defective solar cells, extracted from electroluminescence (EL) images of solar modules. It is intended to facilitate the development of machine learning models for identifying defects in solar cells.\n\nThe dataset is available on GitHub and is intended to promote research and development in the area of solar cell defect detection using computer vision and machine learning techniques.\n\nThe dataset includes images of solar cells and associated labels indicating whether each cell is functional or defective.",
