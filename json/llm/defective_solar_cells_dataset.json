  "Summary": "A dataset of functional and defective solar cells extracted from electroluminescence (EL) images of solar modules.",
  "Description": "This dataset contains images of solar cells that are either functional or defective, extracted from electroluminescence (EL) images of solar modules. The dataset is useful for machine learning tasks focused on the detection and classification of defects in solar cells, which is essential for quality control in photovoltaic manufacturing.\n\nThe images in the dataset capture different states of solar cells and can be used in developing computer vision models aimed at identifying anomalies and defects that affect the performance of solar panels. It serves as a valuable resource for research in photovoltaic systems and solar energy optimization.\n\nThe dataset is available on GitHub, maintained by the organization zae-bayern. It supports work in the fields of machine learning, computer vision, and solar energy technology.",
