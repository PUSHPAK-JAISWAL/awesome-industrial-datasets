  "Summary": "Dataset describes the extrusion process of plastic films focusing on product parameters and defects detected visually to enable defect detection in production.",
  "Description": "The extruder consists of three separate plants that take the granular raw material, and then stretch it into a plastic film by heating and drawing in three layers.\n\nThe quality of the output product is controlled in two aspects: product parameters, and its defects. Parameters such as film thickness and stretch are monitored by sensors, but defects are observed only visually by the operator, and not always in real time (there is a practice of determining the time of a defect by the length of the film and bookmark markers). Production technologists attribute these defects to several factors, including equipment malfunction and poor quality of incoming raw materials.\n\nThe most important type of defect is film breakage, and it is what the customer asks to minimize. It occurs for various reasons, some of a mechanical nature, for example, a speck that fell into the \u201chead\u201d of the extruder. Some are due to other types of defects; The 3 most common are holes on the canvas, non-melting of raw granules and the output of scale. At present, there is no practice of observing these defects on the installation data; laboratory tests of samples are the maximum. Such defects do not necessarily lead to cliffs.",
