  "Description": "This data set contains electricity consumption of 370 points/clients.\n\nData set has no missing values. Values are in kW of each 15 min. To convert values in kWh values must be divided by 4. Each column represents one client. Some clients were created after 2011. In these cases consumption were considered zero.\n\nAll time labels report to Portuguese hour. However all days present 96 measures (24*4). Every year in March time change day (which has only 23 hours) the values between 1:00 am and 2:00 am are zero for all points. Every year in October time change day (which has 25 hours) the values between 1:00 am and 2:00 am aggregate the consumption of two hours.",
