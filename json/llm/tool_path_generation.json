  "Summary": "Shape deviation measurements and corresponding simulated cutting conditions for self-optimizing tool path generation in 5-axis machining processes. The dataset includes measurements from pocket A and pocket B configurations, with and without compensation.",
  "Description": "Shape deviation measurements and corresponding simulated cutting conditions.\nPlease refer to the corresponding paper for the experimental setup.\n\nFeature Description:\nMeasuredDeviation - Actual measured deviation [mm]\nWidthOfCut - Width of cut determined with process parallel material simuation [mm]\nDepthOfCut - Width of cut determined with process parallel material simuation [mm]\nHeightAtTool - Projected distance from probed surface point to tool tip along tool axis determined with process parallel material simuation [mm]\nMaterialRemovalRate - Material removal ratedetermined with process parallel material simuation [cm^3/min]\nFeedrate - Feedrate determined with process parallel material simuation [m/min]\nX,Y,Z - Location of probed point in workpiece coordinates [mm]\n\nThe dataset includes measurements from Pocket A and Pocket B, both with and without compensation. The data was collected using systematic and random point selection methods.",
