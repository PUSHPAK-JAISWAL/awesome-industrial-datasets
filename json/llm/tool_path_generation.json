  "Summary": "Shape deviation measurements and corresponding simulated cutting conditions for self-optimizing tool path generation in 5-axis machining processes.",
  "Description": "Shape deviation measurements and corresponding simulated cutting conditions are provided. The dataset supports research in self-optimizing tool path generation for 5-axis machining processes. Please refer to the corresponding paper for the experimental setup.\n\nThe dataset features variables such as Actual measured deviation, widths and depths of cut, height at tool, material removal rate, feedrate, and location coordinates of probed points in workpiece coordinates. Data selection includes systematic and random point selections from different sample parts with and without compensation applied.\n\nPocket A and Pocket B include measurements without compensation and with compensation, each having systematic and random sampling from three to nine sample parts. This enables comprehensive evaluation of machining conditions and tolerances for optimization purposes.",
