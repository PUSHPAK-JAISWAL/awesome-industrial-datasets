  "Description": "This dataset covers the main parameters of the oil well operation (well \u2116 807).\nI work as a lead geologist in an oil field in Siberia and oversee the development of an oil field. Every day I collect real data on the work of oil wells.\nThis well was drilled in 2013 at an oil field in the north of Russia. The depth of this well is 2400 meters.\n\nAn oil reservoir contains oil and gas dissolved in it under high pressure. There is water in the reservoir below the oil. After the completion of the well construction, a pump is lowered into the well, into which a liquid containing oil, gas and water is supplied. On the surface of the well, a sample is taken every day, which shows how much water and oil is contained in this well in percent (\"Water cut (%)\").\nFrom the well, the liquid enters the metering unit, which calculates how much fluid the well produces per day (\"Volume of liquid (m3 / day)\") and how much gas (\"Gas volume (m3 / day)\"). Knowing these parameters, the volume of oil and water produced can be calculated.\n\nData about the dynamic level (\"Dynamic level (meters)\") is taken every day. A sensor installed in the pump shows reservoir pressure in the well (\"Reservoir pressure (atm)\"). As the well is operated, reservoir pressure decreases and oil production decreases accordingly. More water and less oil and gas indicate depletion of the oil field affecting profitability.\n\nUsing these data, a 3D model of the field and graphs can be built to understand the development stage, estimate produced and remaining oil, and predict production decline along with possible measures to increase oil production.",
