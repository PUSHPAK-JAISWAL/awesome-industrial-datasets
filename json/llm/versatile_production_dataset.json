  "Summary": "Data for condition monitoring and predictive maintenance of the Versatile Production System (VPS), part of the SmartFactory OWL. Includes measurements from various modules such as delivery, storage, dosing, filling, and production of popcorn.",
  "Description": "The Versatile Production System (VPS) dataset contains sensor and control data from an industrial production plant designed to produce popcorn. The VPS is part of the SmartFactory OWL research initiative and has been used in various projects including IMPROVE.\n\nThe production system comprises several modules: delivery (transporting corn material via conveyor belts and pressure conveyors to storage), storage (a container where corn is pneumatically transferred to the dosing module), dosing (pre-defining corn amounts transported pneumatically using load cells and dosing screws), filling (filling corn into bottles with cleaning, portioning, lid placing and screwing, and quality control via a camera), and production (popcorn is produced by heated air expansion in a glass cylinder, with weight-based routing of outputs).\n\nThe dataset captures real operational data reflecting different sensors and binary status signals (e.g., silo fullness, aspirator on/off), which may be used for various machine learning tasks such as anomaly detection, alarm management, and predictive maintenance.",
