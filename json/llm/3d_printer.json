  "Summary": "This dataset comes from research by TR/Selcuk University Mechanical Engineering department. The aim is to determine how the adjustment parameters in 3D printers affect print quality, accuracy, and strength.",
  "Description": "The dataset is based on the Ultimaker S5 3D printer settings and filaments, with materials and strength tests carried out on a Sincotec GMBH tester capable of pulling 20 kN.\n\nIt comprises nine setting parameters including layer height, wall thickness, infill density and pattern, nozzle and bed temperature, print speed, material, and fan speed. The measured output parameters are roughness, tension (ultimate) strength, and elongation.\n\nThe study attempts to estimate which material is used based on input and output parameters using kNN and DNN algorithms. This dataset supports mechanical engineering research and machine learning analysis for 3D printing parameters.",
