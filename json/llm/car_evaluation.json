  "Description": "Car Evaluation Database was derived from a simple hierarchical decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX, M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990. The model evaluates cars according to the following concept structure:\n\nCAR car acceptability\n. PRICE overall price\n. . buying buying price\n. . maint price of the maintenance\n. TECH technical characteristics\n. . COMFORT comfort\n. . . doors number of doors\n. . . persons capacity in terms of persons to carry\n. . . lug_boot the size of luggage boot\n. . safety estimated safety of the car\n\nInput attributes are printed in lowercase. Besides the target concept (CAR), the model includes three intermediate concepts: PRICE, TECH, COMFORT. Every concept is in the original model related to its lower level descendants by a set of examples (for these examples sets see http://www-ai.ijs.si/BlazZupan/car.html).\n\nThe Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety. Because of known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.",
