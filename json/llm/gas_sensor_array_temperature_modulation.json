  "Summary": "A chemical detection platform composed of 14 temperature-modulated metal oxide (MOX) gas sensors was exposed during 3 weeks to mixtures of carbon monoxide and humid synthetic air in a gas chamber. The acquired time series of the sensors and the measured values of CO concentration, humidity and temperature inside the gas chamber are provided.",
  "Description": "A chemical detection platform composed of 14 temperature-modulated metal oxide semiconductor (MOX) gas sensors was exposed to dynamic mixtures of carbon monoxide (CO) and humid synthetic air in a gas chamber. The acquired time series of the sensors and the measured values of CO concentration, humidity and temperature inside the gas chamber are provided. \n\na) Chemical detection platform: \nThe chemical detection platform was composed of 14 MOX gas sensors that generate a time-dependent multivariate response to the different gas stimuli. The utilized sensors were made commercially available by Figaro Engineering (7 units of TGS 3870-A04) and FIS (7 units of SB-500-12).\n\nd) Experimental protocol: \nEach experiment consisted on 100 measurements: 10 experimental concentrations uniformly distributed in the range 0-20 ppm and 10 replicates per concentration. Each replicate had a relative humidity randomly chosen from a uniform distribution between 15% and 75% r.h. At the beginning of each experiment, the gas chamber was cleaned for 15 min using a stream of synthetic air at a flow rate of 240 mln/min.",
