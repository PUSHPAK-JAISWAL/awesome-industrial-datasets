  "Summary": "This dataset is about a flotation plant process used to concentrate iron ore, with the goal to predict the % of silica (impurity) in the iron ore concentrate.",
  "Description": "It is not always easy to find databases from real-world manufacturing plants, specially mining plants. This dataset comes from a flotation plant, an important part of the mining process.\n\nThe main goal is to use this data to predict the amount of impurity (silica) in the ore concentrate, which is measured every hour. Predicting this early can help engineers take corrective actions in advance, reducing impurity and helping the environment by minimizing the amount of ore that goes to tailings.\n\nThe dataset contains time and date range from March 2017 until September 2017. Sampling rates vary, with some columns sampled every 20 seconds and others on an hourly basis. The features include quality measures before the flotation plant, important process variables affecting ore quality, and final ore quality measurements from the lab. The target variable is the % of silica in the iron ore concentrate.",
