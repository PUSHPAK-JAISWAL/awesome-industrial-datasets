  "Summary": "This repository provides a collection of benchmark Remaining Useful Life datasets packaged as PyTorch Lightning Data Modules for integration into PyTorch Lightning workflows.",
  "Description": "This library contains a collection of common benchmark datasets for remaining useful lifetime (RUL) estimation. They are provided as LightningDataModules to be readily used in PyTorch Lightning.\n\nCurrently, five datasets are supported: C-MAPSS Turbofan Degradation Dataset, FEMTO (PRONOSTIA) Bearing Dataset, XJTU-SY Bearing Dataset, N-C-MAPSS New Turbofan Degradation Dataset, and a Dummy dataset for testing and debugging purposes.\n\nIn addition to the basic data modules, the library offers higher-order data modules designed for advanced experiments in transfer learning, unsupervised domain adaptation, and semi-supervised learning. These higher-order modules accept one or more of the basic modules as inputs and adapt them to specific use-case requirements.",
