  "Summary": "2018 Scada data of a wind turbine in Turkey, measuring attributes like wind speed, wind direction, and generated power at 10-minute intervals.",
  "Description": "In Wind Turbines, Scada Systems measure and save data such as wind speed, wind direction, generated power, etc., at 10-minute intervals. This dataset was collected from a wind turbine's Scada system that operates and generates power in Turkey.\n\nThe data includes Date/Time stamps for 10-minute intervals, LV ActivePower (kW) which is the power generated by the turbine at that moment, Wind Speed (m/s) at the hub height of the turbine used for electricity generation, Theoretical Power Curve (KWh) values provided by the turbine manufacturer indicating theoretical power output for given wind speeds, and Wind Direction (\u00b0) at the hub height (the direction to which the turbine automatically turns).\n\nThe dataset contains one CSV file with 5 columns and covers data from the end of 2017 through 2018. It is useful for regression tasks such as predicting power generation based on wind characteristics.",
