  "Summary": "The NEU Surface Defect Dataset contains images for surface defect detection and classification of hot-rolled steel strips collected by Northeastern University.",
  "Description": "The NEU Surface Defect Dataset is a collection of six common surface defects on hot-rolled steel strips.\n\nThe dataset is intended for the purpose of machine learning research on surface defect detection and classification in industrial steel production. It provides labeled image data that include typical surface defects such as crazing, inclusion, patches, pitted surface, rolled-in scale, and scratches.\n\nThe dataset can be used to develop and test image classification algorithms, helping improve the quality inspection process in steel manufacturing.",
