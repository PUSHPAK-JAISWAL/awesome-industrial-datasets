  "Summary": "ToyADMOS is a machine operating sounds dataset containing approximately 540 hours of normal operating sounds and over 12,000 anomalous sound samples collected with four microphones at a 48kHz sampling rate. It includes three sub-datasets\u2014toy car, toy conveyor, and toy train\u2014for different machine inspection and fault diagnosis tasks.",
  "Description": "ToyADMOS dataset is a machine operating sounds dataset of approximately 540 hours of normal machine operating sounds and over 12,000 samples of anomalous sounds collected with four microphones at a 48kHz sampling rate, prepared by Yuma Koizumi and members in NTT Media Intelligence Laboratories. The dataset consists of three sub-datasets: \u201ctoy car\u201d for product inspection tasks, \u201ctoy conveyor\u201d for fault diagnosis of fixed machines, and \u201ctoy train\u201d for fault diagnosis of moving machines.\n\nSince the total size of the ToyADMOS dataset is over 440GB, each sub-dataset is split into 7\u20139 files using 7-zip (7z format). The total size of the compressed dataset is approximately 180GB, and each sub-dataset is approximately 60GB. Users can download the split archive files and use their preferred compression tool to extract the data.\n\nFurther details of the dataset are described in [1] and on GitHub: https://github.com/YumaKoizumi/ToyADMOS-dataset.
