  "Summary": "Each record represents 100 points on a two-dimensional graph. When plotted in order (from 1 through 100) as the Y co-ordinate, the points will create either a Hill (a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbump\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the terrain) or a Valley (a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdip\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the terrain).",
