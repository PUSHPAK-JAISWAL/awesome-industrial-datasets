  "Summary": "The Open Reaction Database is an open access chemical reaction database to support machine learning and related efforts in reaction prediction, chemical synthesis planning, and experiment design. The project\u2019s initial meeting took place on 31 October 2019 with experts from pharma, academia, and tech.",
  "Description": "We are building an open access chemical reaction database to support machine learning and related efforts in reaction prediction, chemical synthesis planning, and experiment design. Our initial meeting took place on 31 October 2019 and included experts from pharma, academia, and tech.\n\nWe expect that this database will be the starting point for the development of best-in-class tools and models for reaction prediction and synthesis planning. Additionally, we hope it will serve as a basis for experimental efforts in industry and academia (e.g., to reduce duplication or focus data generation on underrepresented areas).",
