  "Summary": "The ISDB (International Stiction Data Base) contains data related to stiction, a common valve problem in process industries. It can be used to test and develop methods for stiction detection, diagnosis, and quantification in control loops.",
  "Description": "The data in ISDB.zip is used in the book 'Detection and Diagnosis of Stiction in Control Loops: State of the Art and Advanced Methods' by Mohieddine Jelali and Biao Huang.\n\nThe book presents various techniques for overcoming stiction, including their principles, assumptions, strengths, and drawbacks. It provides guidelines and working procedures for implementing each method.\n\nMATLAB-based software is available for download, enabling readers to apply the methods to their own data.",
