  "Summary": "Crude oil production data by OECD.org including quantities of oil extracted from the ground measured in thousand tonnes of oil equivalent (toe).",
  "Description": "Crude oil production is defined as the quantities of oil extracted from the ground after the removal of inert matter or impurities. It includes crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and additives. This indicator is measured in thousand tonne of oil equivalent (toe). Crude oil is a mineral oil consisting of a mixture of hydrocarbons of natural origin, yellow to black in colour, and of variable density and viscosity. NGLs are the liquid or liquefied hydrocarbons produced in the manufacture, purification and stabilisation of natural gas. Additives are non-hydrocarbon substances added to or blended with a product to modify its properties, for example, to improve its combustion characteristics (e.g. MTBE and tetraethyl lead). Refinery production refers to the output of secondary oil products from an oil refinery.\n\nThis dataset is a collection of crude oil production data originally provided by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and made available on Kaggle for the community. The data includes production values over time and covers multiple countries using ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 three-letter country codes.\n\nThe dataset is useful for forecasting oil production by country, implementing machine learning models, and for data analysis and visualization of oil production trends across countries. The data is downloadable as a CSV file and is well suited for time series regression tasks.",
