  "Summary": "This dataset contains IoT sensor data for fault classification in industrial settings, with measurements from temperature, vibration, pressure, flow rate, current, and voltage sensors. The Fault_Type label categorizes observations into normal operation, overheating, leakage, and power fluctuation faults.",
  "Description": "This dataset is designed for automated fault detection in Industry 4.0 applications using IoT-based smart sensors. It contains data of industrial sensor data collected from various sources, including Temperature Sensors (\u00b0C), Vibration Sensors (m/s\u00b2), Pressure Sensors (kPa), Flow Rate Sensors (L/min), Current Sensors (A), and Voltage Sensors (V).\n\nThe dataset includes a Fault_Type label with four categories:\n0 \u2192 No Fault (Normal Operation)\n1 \u2192 Overheating Fault\n2 \u2192 Leakage Fault\n3 \u2192 Power Fluctuation Fault",
