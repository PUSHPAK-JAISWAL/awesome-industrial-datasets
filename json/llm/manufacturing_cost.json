  "Summary": "Data relating manufacturing cost to the number of units produced used to estimate cost of goods sold based on production volume.",
  "Description": "Let's assume that you work as a consultant to a start-up company that was looking to develop a model to estimate the cost of goods sold as they vary the production volume (number of units produced). The startup gathered data and has asked you to develop a model to predict its cost vs. the number of units sold.\n\nThe dataset contains two columns: 'Number of Units' and 'Manufacturing Cost'. The values represent manufacturing cost as a function of quantity. This data is suited for regression tasks to model economies of scale in manufacturing and estimate costs associated with varying production volumes.\n\nThe data file included is 'EconomiesOfScale.csv' which is around 24.78 kB in size and contains the measurements collected. The dataset is practical for users interested in manufacturing, cost estimation, and production volume relationships.",
