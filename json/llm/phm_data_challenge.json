  "Summary": "The PHM Data Challenge focuses on fault detection and prognostics in industrial plant monitoring. Participants are scored on their ability to detect plant faults and localize them in time.",
  "Description": "The PHM Data Challenge is a competition focused on fault detection and prognostics, a common problem in industrial plant monitoring. Participants are evaluated on their ability to detect plant faults from a set of potential faults and to precisely localize faults in time.\n\nData includes time series of sensor measurements and control reference signals for plant components, additional measurements of plant zones, and plant fault events characterized by start time, end time, and failure code. The task is to predict future failure events and their time of occurrence from past data.\n\nThe frequency of measurements is approximately one sample every 15 minutes, and the time series data spans a period of approximately three to four years.",
