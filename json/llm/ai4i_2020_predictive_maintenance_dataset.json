  "Summary": "The AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset is a synthetic dataset that reflects real predictive maintenance data encountered in industry.",
  "Description": "Since real predictive maintenance datasets are generally difficult to obtain and in particular difficult to publish, we present and provide a synthetic dataset that reflects real predictive maintenance encountered in industry to the best of our knowledge.\n\nThe dataset consists of 10,000 data points stored as rows with 14 features in columns including UID, product ID, air temperature (K), process temperature (K), rotational speed (rpm), torque (Nm), tool wear (min), and machine failure labels, among others.\n\nThe machine failure label indicates whether the machine has failed due to one or more of five independent failure modes: tool wear failure (TWF), heat dissipation failure (HDF), power failure (PWF), overstrain failure (OSF), and random failures (RNF). Each failure mode is defined with specific conditions and probabilities as described in the dataset documentation.",
