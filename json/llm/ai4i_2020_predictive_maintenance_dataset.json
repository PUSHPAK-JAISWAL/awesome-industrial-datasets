  "Description": "The AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset is a synthetic dataset that reflects real predictive maintenance data encountered in industry. Since real predictive maintenance datasets are generally difficult to obtain and in particular difficult to publish, a synthetic dataset is presented that reflects real predictive maintenance encountered in industry to the best of our knowledge.\n\nThis dataset consists of 10 000 data points stored as rows with 14 features in columns: UID, product ID, Type, Air temperature, Process temperature, Rotational speed, Torque, Tool wear, Machine failure, and TWF.\n\nThe machine failure consists of five independent failure modes: tool wear failure (TWF), heat dissipation failure (HDF), power failure (PWF), overstrain failure (OSF), and random failures (RNF). If at least one of the above failure modes is true, the process fails and the 'machine failure' label is set to 1.",
