  "Summary": "The data set addresses the condition assessment of a hydraulic test rig based on multi sensor data. Four fault types are superimposed with several severity grades impeding selective quantification.",
  "Description": "The data set was experimentally obtained with a hydraulic test rig. This test rig consists of a primary working and a secondary cooling-filtration circuit which are connected via the oil tank [1], [2]. The system cyclically repeats constant load cycles (duration 60 seconds) and measures process values such as pressures, volume flows and temperatures while the condition of four hydraulic components (cooler, valve, pump and accumulator) is quantitatively varied.\n\nAttribute Information:\nThe data set contains raw process sensor data (i.e. without feature extraction) which are structured as matrices (tab-delimited) with the rows representing the cycles and the columns the data points within a cycle. The sensors involved are:\nPS1-PS6 (Pressure, bar, 100 Hz), EPS1 (Motor power, W, 100 Hz), FS1-FS2 (Volume flow, l/min, 10 Hz), TS1-TS4 (Temperature, \u00b0C, 1 Hz), VS1 (Vibration, mm/s, 1 Hz), CE (Cooling efficiency, %, 1 Hz), CP (Cooling power, kW, 1 Hz), SE (Efficiency factor, %, 1 Hz).\n\nThe target condition values are cycle-wise annotated in \"profile.txt\" (tab-delimited), with the columns representing cooler condition percentage, valve condition percentage, internal pump leakage, hydraulic accumulator pressure in bar, and a stable flag indicating if conditions were stable or not.",
