  "Summary": "This dataset contains minute-level real-time sensor data from an IoT-enabled smart manufacturing system. It records machine parameters (temperature, vibration, power consumption, material flow rate) and production outcomes (error rates, downtime, maintenance needs, efficiency scores).",
  "Description": "This dataset captures real-time, sensor-driven data from an IoT-enabled smart manufacturing system designed for optimizing production efficiency and job scheduling using Digital Twin (DT) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies. It includes timestamped records at one-minute intervals, unique machine identifiers and types, and key process parameters such as temperature, vibration level, power consumption, pressure, and material flow rate.\n\nThe dataset also tracks production outcomes and performance indicators, including cycle_time, error_rate, downtime, maintenance_flag, efficiency_score, and a binary production_status. These fields support analysis of system performance, predictive maintenance, and efficiency optimization in a multivariate time-series context.",
