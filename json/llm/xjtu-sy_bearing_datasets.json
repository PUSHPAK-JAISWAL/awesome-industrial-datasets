  "Summary": "The XJTU-SY Bearing Datasets provide run-to-failure vibration data of 15 rolling element bearings collected under three different operating conditions to support the validation of prognostic algorithms. Vibration signals were sampled at 25.6 kHz using two accelerometers mounted horizontally and vertically.",
  "Description": "The XJTU-SY bearing datasets are provided by the Institute of Design Science and Basic Component at Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University and the Changxing Sumyoung Technology Co., Ltd. They contain complete run-to-failure data of 15 rolling element bearings acquired through accelerated degradation experiments under three operating conditions: 2100 rpm and 12 kN, 2250 rpm and 11 kN, and 2400 rpm and 10 kN.\n\nVibration signals were recorded every minute with two PCB 352C33 accelerometers mounted at 90\u00b0 on the bearing housing, sampling 32768 data points (1.28 seconds) at 25.6 kHz. For each sampling, data were saved in CSV format with the first column as horizontal vibration and the second column as vertical vibration.\n\nThe data packet (XJTU-SY_Bearing_Datasets.zip) includes all CSV files for the 15 tested bearings. Each bearing\u2019s lifetime, number of CSV files, and fault type can be found in the provided tables and failure photographs, illustrating faults such as inner race wear, cage fracture, and outer race damage.",
