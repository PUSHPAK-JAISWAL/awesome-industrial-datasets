  "Description": "The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant.\n\nA combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. While the Vacuum is collected from and has effect on the Steam Turbine, the other three ambient variables affect the GT performance.\n\nFor comparability with baseline studies, and to allow 5x2 fold statistical tests to be carried out, the data is provided shuffled five times. For each shuffling, 2-fold cross-validation is carried out and the resulting 10 measurements are used for statistical testing. Data is available in .ods and .xlsx formats.",
