  "Summary": "The dataset is constructed from images of defective production items that were provided and annotated by Kolektor Group d.o.o. in a controlled industrial environment in a real-world case.",
  "Description": "The Kolektor Surface-Defect Dataset consists of 399 images of production items, including 52 images with visible defects and 347 images without any defects. Original images have a width of 500 pixels and height varying from 1240 to 1270 pixels. For training and evaluation, images should be resized to 512 x 1408 pixels. Each item has at least one image where the defect is visible, with two items having defects on two images. The dataset provides negative examples with non-defective surfaces for robust model training.\n\nThe dataset has been annotated with fine and box annotations available for download to support several research papers. It is split into three folds for 3-fold cross-validation, with prepared TensorFlow datasets available. The dataset is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License, and commercial use requires contacting Danijel Sko\u010daj. The dataset is used for defect detection in industrial surface images and supports segmentation-based deep-learning approaches.",
