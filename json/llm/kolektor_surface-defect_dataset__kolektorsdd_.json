  "Description": "The dataset is constructed from images of defective production items that were provided and annotated by Kolektor Group d.o.o.. The images were captured in a controlled industrial environment in a real-world case.\n\nThe dataset consists of 399 images, with 52 images containing visible defects and 347 images without any defect. The original images have a width of 500 pixels and a height ranging from 1240 to 1270 pixels. For training and evaluation, the images should be resized to 512 x 1408 pixels.\n\nFor each item, the defect is only visible in at least one image, while two items have defects on two images, which means there were 52 images where the defects are visible. The remaining 347 images serve as negative examples with non-defective surfaces.",
