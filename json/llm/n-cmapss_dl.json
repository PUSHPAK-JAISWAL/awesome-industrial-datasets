  "Summary": "N-CMAPSS data preparation for Machine Learning and Deep Learning models provided as Python source code for a new CMAPSS dataset.",
  "Description": "This repository contains Python code to preprocess and generate the N-CMAPSS dataset, a variant of the commercial modular aero-propulsion system simulation data set for predictive maintenance modeling.\n\nThe code implements data preparation steps for machine learning and deep learning, supporting tasks such as remaining useful life prediction on turbofan engine sensor data.\n\nUsers can leverage the provided scripts to reproduce the new CMAPSS dataset and integrate it into prognostic modeling workflows.",
