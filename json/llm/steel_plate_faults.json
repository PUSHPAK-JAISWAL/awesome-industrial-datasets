  "Summary": "A dataset of steel plates\u2019 faults, classified into 7 different types. The goal was to train machine learning for automatic pattern recognition.",
  "Description": "This dataset contains data on steel plates faults classified into seven types: Pastry, Z_Scratch, K_Scatch, Stains, Dirtiness, Bumps, and Other_Faults. The dataset includes 27 independent variables with integer and real feature types.\n\nThe dataset aims to provide records to train machine learning models for automatic pattern recognition in fault detection on steel plates. The dataset contains no missing values and is based on real data.\n\nThe features describe various physical properties and measurements related to the steel plates, such as X_Minimum, X_Maximum, Y_Minimum, Y_Maximum, Pixels_Areas, X_Perimeter, Y_Perimeter, and Luminosity indices among others.",
