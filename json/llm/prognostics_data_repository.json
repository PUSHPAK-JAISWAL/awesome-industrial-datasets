  "Description": "The Prognostics Data Repository is a collection of data sets donated by various universities, agencies, or companies. Its focus is exclusively on prognostic data sets, which primarily consist of time-series data capturing the progression from a nominal state to a failed state. The repository is actively growing as new data sets are continuously added.\n\nUsers are requested to acknowledge this repository and the data donors in any publications using these data sets to help others access the same datasets and to credit the contributors. Data is used at the user's own risk, with no liability assumed by NASA or data contributors for any use of the data or derived systems.\n\nThe repository includes diverse datasets such as Algae Raceway experiments, Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Polymer Composites, Milling machine wear data, Bearings data, Li-Ion battery experiments, Turbofan Engine Degradation simulations, and multiple others, covering a wide variety of prognostic contexts and applications.",
