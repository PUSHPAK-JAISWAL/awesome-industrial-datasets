  "Summary": "A comprehensive, global, open source database of power plants. The 'Primary Fuel' is the fuel that has been identified to provide the largest portion of generated electricity for the plant or has been identified as the primary fuel by the data source.",
  "Description": "The \"Primary Fuel\" is the fuel that has been identified to provide the largest portion of generated electricity for the plant or has been identified as the primary fuel by the data source.\n\nFor power plants that have data in multiple Other Fuel fields, the ordering of the fuels should not be taken to indicate any priority or preference of the fuel for operating the power plant or generating units. Though the \"Other Fuel\" columns in the database are numbered sequentially from 1, the ordering is insignificant.\n\nGeneration is provided at the year scale for the years 2013-2017. The generation values may correspond to a calendar year or a fiscal or regulatory year; no distinction is provided in the database.",
