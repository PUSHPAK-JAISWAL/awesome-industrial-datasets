  "Summary": "A comprehensive, global, open source database of power plants.",
  "Description": "The Global Power Plant Database provides an extensive open source dataset including information about power plants worldwide. It contains data including the primary fuel that supplies the largest portion of generated electricity for each plant, the generation values at a year scale for years 2013-2017, among other plant characteristics.\n\nIt is noted that for plants with multiple fuels specified, the other fuels' order does not indicate priority or preference. The generation data may correspond to calendar, fiscal, or regulatory years, without distinction provided. The database aims to support climate, economics, and finance related research and applications by providing detailed and comprehensive power plant information.\n\nCaution is advised when interpreting 'Primary Fuel' and 'Other Fuel' fields, as ordering does not always imply operational priority. This dataset is maintained and provided by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and updated as of October 16, 2024.",
