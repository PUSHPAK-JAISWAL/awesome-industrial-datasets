  "Summary": "Revenue data of the top defense manufacturing companies worldwide for the years 2019 and 2020.",
  "Description": "A defense contractor is a business organization or individual that provides products or services to a military or intelligence department of a government. Products include military or civilian aircraft, ships, vehicles, weaponry, and electronic systems, while services include logistics, technical support, training, communications support, and engineering support in cooperation with the government.\n\nSecurity contractors usually do not provide direct support of military operations. In the United States, defense contracting has expanded significantly, with contractors often outnumbering military personnel in conflict zones. For example, during the first four years of the Iraq War, more than 190,000 contractors were hired, surpassing the American military presence.\n\nThis dataset includes information on the revenue of the top defense manufacturing companies ranked by their defense revenue for the year 2020 and 2019, as well as company leadership and country of origin. It provides detailed company rankings, revenue figures in $US Million, profit/loss percentages, and the proportion of total revenue sourced from defense activities.",
