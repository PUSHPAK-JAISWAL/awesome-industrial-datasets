  "Summary": "AssetOpsBench is a benchmark suite for evaluating AI agents on task automation in industrial asset operations and maintenance. It provides domain-specific scenarios and multi-agent orchestration frameworks.",
  "Description": "AssetOpsBench provides a collection of over 140 scenarios covering IoT data retrieval, failure mode and sensor relation discovery, time series anomaly detection, and work order generation. Each scenario reflects common tasks faced by maintenance engineers and reliability specialists, enabling end-to-end evaluation of AI-driven workflows.\n\nThe framework includes four domain-specific agents (IoT, FMSR, TSFM, WO) with dedicated tools and two orchestration frameworks (MetaAgent and AgentHive) to coordinate complex multi-step workflows. AssetOpsBench is delivered in a simulated industrial environment, facilitating reproducible benchmarking of agent performance across diverse tasks.",
