  "Summary": "Classification of urban land cover using high resolution aerial imagery. Intended to assist sustainable urban planning efforts.",
  "Description": "Contains training and testing data for classifying a high resolution aerial image into 9 types of urban land cover. Multi-scale spectral, size, shape, and texture information are used for classification. There are a low number of training samples for each class (14-30) and a high number of classification variables (148), so it may be an interesting data set for testing feature selection methods.\n\nThe testing data set is from a random sampling of the image.\n\nClass is the target classification variable. The land cover classes are: trees, grass, soil, concrete, asphalt, buildings, cars, pools, shadows.",
