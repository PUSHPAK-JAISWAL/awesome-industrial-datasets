  "Description": "The PHM Data Challenge focuses on asset health calculation, a common problem in industrial remote monitoring and diagnostics. Participants are scored on their ability to generate a health score that accurately segments a population of assets into high and low risks of failure.\n\nThere are 5 data sets. Due to proprietary concerns we cannot provide a detailed description of the data and the domain. The datasets include Train \u2013 Part Consumption.csv, Train \u2013 Usage.csv, Train \u2013 Failures.csv, Test \u2013 Part Consumption.csv, Test \u2013 Usage.csv, Test Instances.csv, and Example Submission.csv.\n\nEach team is permitted one submission a week. A submission will be composed of a CSV file whose name is the team alias. The first line of the CSV file should be the value that segments the health scores into low and high risk.",
