  "Summary": "Detecting anomalies in semiconductor wafer manufacturing using machine learning models to classify good or anomalous products with a highly imbalanced dataset.",
  "Description": "Detecting Anomalies can be a difficult task and especially in the case of labeled datasets due to some level of human bias introduced while labeling the final product as anomalous or good. These giant manufacturing systems need to be monitored every 10 milliseconds to capture their behavior which brings in lots of information and what we call the Industrial IoT (IIOT). Also, hardly a manufacturer wants to create an anomalous product. Hence, the anomalies are like a needle in a haystack which renders the dataset significantly imbalanced.\n\nThe dataset is collected from one of India's leading manufacturers of wafers (semiconductors). The dataset collected was anonymized to hide the feature names, and there are 1558 features which require domain knowledge to interpret properly.\n\nIn this context, participants create machine learning or deep learning models to classify anomalies in the manufacturing data, optimizing the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric to generalize well on unseen test data. The provided files include Train.csv with 1763 rows and 1559 columns and Test.csv with 756 rows and 1558 columns, along with a sample submission file.",
