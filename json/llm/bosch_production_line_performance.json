  "Summary": "Bosch records data at every step along its assembly lines, enabling prediction of internal failures using thousands of measurements and tests for each component along the production line.",
  "Description": "Bosch, one of the world's leading manufacturing companies, monitors its parts as they progress through assembly lines to ensure quality and safety standards. The dataset includes thousands of measurements and tests made for each component along the assembly line, which presents complexities due to the intricacies of the production process.\n\nThis data enables advanced analytics to improve manufacturing processes by predicting internal failures, which can help Bosch bring higher quality products at lower costs to the end user.\n\nThe prediction task is a binary classification where the goal is to predict internal failures based on the extensive sensor data collected during production. The evaluation metric used is the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) which considers true and false positives and negatives.",
