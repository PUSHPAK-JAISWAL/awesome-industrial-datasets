  "Summary": "Classify ceramic samples based on their chemical composition from energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence.",
  "Description": "The energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) was used to determine the chemical composition of celadon body and glaze in Longquan kiln (at Dayao County) and Jingdezhen kiln. Forty typical shards in four cultural eras were selected to investigate the raw materials and firing technology. We hope to identify chemical elements that are strongest explanatory variables to classify samples into different cultural eras and kilns.\n\nThis dataset contains measurements of percentages of various chemical components and elements in ceramic samples. The dataset comprises samples from two kiln locations and different cultural eras, allowing classification and clustering tasks based on chemical composition.\n\nVariable information includes ceramic type names, part type (Body or Glaze), and the percentages of elements such as Na2O, MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, K2O, CaO, TiO2, Fe2O3, MnO, CuO, ZnO, PbO2, Rb2O, SrO, Y2O3, ZrO2, and P2O5 with weight percentage and ppm measurements.",
