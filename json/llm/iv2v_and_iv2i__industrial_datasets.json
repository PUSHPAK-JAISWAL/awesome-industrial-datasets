  "Description": "This repository provides support code and documentation related to the AI4Mobile industrial wireless datasets, namely iV2V (industrial vehicle-to-vehicle) and iV2I+ (industrial vehicle-to-infrastructure). The datasets are intended for applications in industrial wireless communication.\n\nThe datasets cover wireless industrial scenarios, supporting research and development in machine learning and communication within industrial environments. The dataset is hosted on IEEE DataPort, an open access platform for datasets.\n\nAdditional specific details such as labeling, timeseries nature, number of instances, and specific features are not provided in the repository summary or associated webpage. Users are directed to the IEEE DataPort link for further information and dataset access.",
