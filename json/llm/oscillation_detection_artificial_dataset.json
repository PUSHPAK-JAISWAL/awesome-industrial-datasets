  "Summary": "Dataset used by the authors\u2019 previous work on a technique for oscillation detection based on Machine Learning.",
  "Description": "This dataset is described as the Oscillation detection artificial dataset (ODADS), which is used by the authors in their previous work concerning a machine learning technique for detecting oscillations.\n\nThe dataset is hosted on the GIMSCOP repository at UFRGS (Group of Intensification, Modeling, Simulation, Control, and Optimization of Processes). It is intended for research in oscillation detection, a common problem in time series or signal analysis domains, likely related to control systems or industrial process monitoring based on the context of the hosting group.\n\nNo specific details regarding the number of instances, features, labeling, or the nature of the data are provided on the webpage. It is available for download via a Google Drive link provided on the site.",
