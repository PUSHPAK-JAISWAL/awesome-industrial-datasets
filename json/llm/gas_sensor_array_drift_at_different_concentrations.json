  "Description": "This data set contains 13,910 measurements from 16 chemical sensors exposed to 6 gases at different concentration levels. This dataset is an extension of the Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset, providing now the information about the concentration level at which the sensors were exposed for each measurement. The primary purpose is to provide an extensive dataset to sensor and AI research communities to develop and test strategies for various tasks including sensor drift and classification.\n\nThe dataset was gathered from January 2008 to February 2011 (36 months) in a gas delivery platform at the ChemoSignals Laboratory, BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. It includes six pure gaseous substances: Ammonia, Acetaldehyde, Acetone, Ethylene, Ethanol, and Toluene at different concentration ranges in ppmv.\n\nThe sensors' responses are recorded as resistance measurements forming 16-channel time series, later aggregated into 128-dimensional feature vectors. The dataset is organized in ten batches for better distribution of experiments across time. Data files represent batches, each line representing a measurement coded with class, concentration, and feature values.",
