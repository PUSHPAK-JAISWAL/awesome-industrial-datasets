  "Summary": "Analyzing Energy Consumption and Environmental Impact in the Steel Industry.",
  "Description": "This dataset contains time series data recorded with timestamps of energy consumption and environmental impact parameters in the steel industry. The data includes energy usage in kilowatt-hours (Usage_kWh), reactive power consumption (both leading and lagging), carbon dioxide emissions (CO2), power factors, normalized solar energy (NSM), and temporal attributes like WeekStatus and Day_Of_Week.\n\nThese features provide insights into the power efficiency, reactive power usage, and environmental emissions over time, useful for regression tasks to model and analyze energy consumption patterns and their impact.\n\nThis dataset is made available under a CC0 Public Domain license, indicating it is free for public use, and was last updated about a year ago. The data is detailed with continuous readings likely spanning from around 2017-12-31 to 2018-12-12, giving an extensive timeline for analysis.",
