  "Summary": "The REDD data set is presented in high frequency (kHz) and low frequency (Hz) groups. High frequency data include current and voltage measurements, while low frequency data cover Power measurement of individual circuits within the houses.",
  "Description": "The REDD data set is presented in high frequency (kHz) and low frequency (Hz) groups. High frequency data include current and voltage measurements, while low frequency data cover Power measurement of individual circuits within the houses.\n\nThe low frequency folder contains six folders, one for each house. Each sub-folder contains a number of channels for different circuits in the house. Labels of each channel which include appliance names are given in a label.dat file in each sub-folder.\n\nThe dataset includes data from 6 residential buildings located in Massachusetts, US. The duration of the data collection ranges from weeks to months, with a sample frequency of kHz/ a few Hz. The level of detail includes whole home and circuit level measurements.",
