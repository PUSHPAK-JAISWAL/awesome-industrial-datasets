  "Summary": "This dataset contains force and torque measurements on a robot after failure detection. Each failure is characterized by 15 force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals.",
  "Description": "The Robot Execution Failures dataset includes 5 datasets, each defining a different learning problem related to failures in robot operations: failures in approach to grasp position, failures in transfer of a part, position of part after a transfer failure, failures in approach to ungrasp position, and failures in motion with part.\n\nEach failure instance is characterized by 15 force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals starting immediately after failure detection, spanning a total observation window of 315 milliseconds. The features are integer-valued and represent the evolution of forces and torques (Fx, Fy, Fz, Tx, Ty, Tz) over these time intervals.\n\nTo improve classification accuracy on these problems, various feature transformation strategies such as statistical summary features and discrete Fourier transform were evaluated, leading to an average improvement of 20% in accuracy according to the reference by Seabra Lopes and Camarinha-Matos (1998).",
