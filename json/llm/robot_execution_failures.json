  "Description": "This dataset contains force and torque measurements on a robot after failure detection. Each failure is characterized by 15 force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals.\n\nThe donation includes 5 datasets, each of them defining a different learning problem:\n\n* LP1: failures in approach to grasp position\n* LP2: failures in transfer of a part\n* LP3: position of part after a transfer failure\n* LP4: failures in approach to ungrasp position\n* LP5: failures in motion with part\n\nIn order to improve classification accuracy, a set of five feature transformation strategies (based on statistical summary features, discrete Fourier transform, etc.) was defined and evaluated. This enabled an average improvement of 20% in accuracy. The most accessible reference is [Seabra Lopes and Camarinha-Matos, 1998].",
