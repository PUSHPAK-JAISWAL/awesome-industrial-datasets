  "Summary": "This dataset records the power demand from five houses, including whole-house mains power demand and power demand from individual appliances, with data collected at resolutions of one and six seconds, and high frequency data at 16 kHz for some houses.",
  "Description": "The UK Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity (UK-DALE) dataset contains detailed electricity usage data from five UK houses. It includes whole-house power demand recorded every six seconds, as well as appliance-level power demand also recorded every six seconds. For three houses (1, 2 and 5), the dataset features high-frequency recordings of whole-house voltage and current sampled at 16 kHz stored as FLAC files. These high frequency FLAC files are around 200 MB each and the entire 16 kHz dataset for April 2017 occupies 7.6 TB.\n\nThe dataset has been released multiple times, with the final and most recent release dated April 2017, providing up to 4.3 years of data for house 1. The data is available in several formats including CSV files for 1-second and 6-second resolution data and an HDF5 format compatible with the NILMTK toolkit. Additional utility meter readings and metadata about houses are also provided.\n\nThe dataset is made freely available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0). It has been described in the publication \"The UK-DALE dataset, domestic appliance-level electricity demand and whole-house demand from five UK homes\" published in Scientific Data in 2015. Users are encouraged to cite this paper and the dataset DOIs when using UK-DALE data.",
