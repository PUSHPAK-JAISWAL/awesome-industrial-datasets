  "Summary": "Promotes development of ML algorithms for early detection and classification of undesirable events in offshore oil wells.",
  "Description": "This is the first repository published by Petrobras on GitHub. It supports the 3W Project, which aims to promote experimentation and development of Machine Learning-based approaches and algorithms for specific problems related to detection and classification of undesirable events that occur in offshore oil wells.\n\nThe 3W Project is based on the 3W Dataset, a database described in a published paper, and on the 3W Toolkit, a software package that promotes experimentation with the 3W Dataset for specific problems. The name 3W was chosen because the dataset comprises instances from three different sources and includes undesirable events in oil wells.\n\nTimely detection of undesirable events in oil wells can help prevent production losses, reduce maintenance costs, environmental accidents, and human casualties. Losses related to this type of events can reach 5% of production in certain scenarios, especially in areas such as Flow Assurance and Artificial Lifting Methods. Maintenance costs are also high, with maritime probe operations costing up to US $500,000 per day.",
