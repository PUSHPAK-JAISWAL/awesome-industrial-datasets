  "Summary": "The dataset contains energy consumption data collected from the DAEWOO Steel Co. Ltd in Gwangyang, South Korea, including information about electricity usage, reactive power, power factors, CO2 emissions, and temporal features.",
  "Description": "The information gathered is from the DAEWOO Steel Co. Ltd in Gwangyang, South Korea. It produces several types of coils, steel plates, and iron plates. The information on electricity consumption is held in a cloud-based system. The energy consumption data includes various features such as usage in kWh, lagging and leading reactive power (kVarh), CO2 emissions in tCO2, lagging and leading power factors in percentage, number of seconds from midnight, week status, and day of the week.\n\nData covers a period from 2017-12-31 to 2018-12-12, with no missing values reported. Weekday and weekend status and day of the week are provided as categorical features, while the continuous data represents energy consumption and related measures. The dataset is suitable for machine learning tasks including both regression and classification related to energy consumption and operational status.\n\nThe dataset is stored in one file named Steel_industry.csv and offers a detailed view with 11 columns and over 35,000 instances, making it a rich source for energy consumption analysis in the steel industry.",
