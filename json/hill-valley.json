When plotted in order (from 1 through 100) as the Y-coordinate, the points will create either a Hill (a 'bump' in the terrain) or a Valley (a 'dip' in the terrain).\n\nThere are six files, as follows:\n\n(a) Hill_Valley_without_noise_Training.data\n(b) Hill_Valley_without_noise_Testing.data\n\nThese first two datasets (without noise) are a training/testing set pair where the hills or valleys have a smooth transition.\n\n(c) Hill_Valley_with_noise_Training.data\n(d) Hill_Valley_with_noise_Testing.data\n\nThese next two datasets (with noise) are a training/testing set pair where the terrain is uneven, and the hill or valley is not as obvious when viewed closely.\n\n(e) Hill_Valley_sample_arff.text\n\nThe sample ARFF file is useful for setting up experiments, but is not necessary.\n\n(f) Hill_Valley_visual_examples.jpg\n\nThis graphic file shows two example instances from the data."
