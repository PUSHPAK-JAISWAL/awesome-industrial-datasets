It was an outcome of a project initiated by Mohieddine Jelali during the writing of the book 'Detection and Diagnosis of Stiction in Control Loops: State of the Art and Advanced Methods' available at [https://sites.ualberta.ca/~bhuang/Stiction-Book.htm](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~bhuang/Stiction-Book.htm).\n\nThe data were provided by different international colleagues (called Stiction Group) who have contributed to the book. The Stiction Group has decided to publish the database to enable other researchers working in the field to test their own methods on industrial data."
