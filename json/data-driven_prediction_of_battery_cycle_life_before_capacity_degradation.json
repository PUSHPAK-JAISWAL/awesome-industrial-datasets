The cells have a nominal capacity of 1.1 Ah and a nominal voltage of 3.3 V."

The file ethylene_CO.txt contains the recordings from the sensors when exposed to mixtures of Ethylene and CO in air. The file ethylene_methane.txt contains the acquired time series induced by the mixture of Methane and Ethylene in air.\n\nThe structure of the files is the same: Data is distributed in 19 columns. First column represents time (in seconds), second column represents Methane (or CO) concentration set point (in ppm), third column details Ethylene concentration set point (in ppm), and the following 16 columns show the recordings of the sensor array.\n\nFiles include a header (one line) with the information of each column:\n\nTime (seconds), Methane conc (ppm), Ethylene conc (ppm), sensor readings (16 channels)\n\nThe order of the sensors in the files is as follows:\nTGS2602; TGS2602; TGS2600; TGS2600; TGS2610; TGS2610; TGS2620; TGS2620; TGS2602; TGS2602; TGS2600; TGS2600; TGS2610; TGS2610; TGS2620; TGS2620\n\nSensors' readings can be converted to KOhms by 40.000/S_i, where S_i is the value provided in the text files."
