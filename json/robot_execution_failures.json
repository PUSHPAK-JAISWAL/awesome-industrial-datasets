            "Content": "The donation includes 5 datasets, each of them defining a different learning problem:\n\n    * LP1: failures in approach to grasp position\n    * LP2: failures in transfer of a part\n    * LP3: position of part after a transfer failure\n    * LP4: failures in approach to ungrasp position\n    * LP5: failures in motion with part\n\nIn order to improve classification accuracy, a set of five feature transformation strategies (based on statistical summary features, discrete Fourier transform, etc.) was defined and evaluated. This enabled an average improvement of 20% in accuracy. The most accessible reference is [Seabra Lopes and Camarinha-Matos, 1998]."
