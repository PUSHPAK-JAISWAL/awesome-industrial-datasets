High frequency data include current and voltage measurements, while low frequency data cover Power measurement of individual circuits within the houses. The low frequency folder contains six folders, one for each house. Each sub-folder contains a number of channels for different circuits in the house. Labels of each channel which include appliance names are given in a label.dat file in each sub-folder."
