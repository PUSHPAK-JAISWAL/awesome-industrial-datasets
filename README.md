## LLM Assistance for JSON Generation

To save time and maintain a consistent standard, I used a Language Model (LLM) to automatically build the JSON files. The LLM reads the `datasets.csv`, loads each webpage, and creates the JSON based on a predefined template. This approach not only addresses time limitations but also makes it easier to update the JSON files if any changes are required.
