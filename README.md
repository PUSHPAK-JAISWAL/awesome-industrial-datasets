## Acknowledgements

This repository was partly inspired by and developed using ideas from the following repositories:

- [Industrial ML Datasets by Nicolas J92](https://github.com/nicolasj92/industrial-ml-datasets)
- [Awesome Industrial Machine Datasets by Makinarocks](https://github.com/makinarocks/awesome-industrial-machine-datasets)
- [Industrial Surface Inspection Datasets by Donrax](https://github.com/donrax/industrial-surface-inspection-datasets)

Their work provided useful reference points during the development of this project.

## LLM Assistance for JSON Generation

To save time and maintain a consistent standard, I used a Language Model (LLM) to automatically build the JSON files. The LLM reads the `datasets.csv`, loads each webpage, and creates the JSON based on a predefined template. This approach not only addresses time limitations but also makes it easier to update the JSON files if any changes are required.

## Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to our repository.

### How You Can Contribute
You can contribute in several ways:
- **Suggest a New Dataset**: Propose a new dataset by creating an issue under the "Enhancement" label in the Issues tab.
- **Add a Dataset**: Create a JSON file describing a dataset and submit a pull request to add it to the repository.
- **Suggest Changes**: You can suggest improvements through the Issues tab or directly edit the JSON files and submit your changes via a pull request.

### Adding a Dataset
Before adding a new dataset, please ensure that it is unique and not already included in the repository.

To add a dataset:
1. Create a JSON file that accurately describes the dataset, following the same template as the existing datasets in the `json` folder.
2. Place this JSON file in the `json` folder.

#### Updating Documentation
To update the documentation (Markdown and HTML files) and refresh the README:
1. Run the `generate_documentation.py` script located in the root of the repository. This script will:
   - Generate Markdown files in the `markdown` folder.
   - Generate HTML files in the `html` folder.
   - Update the `README.md` file with the latest datasets table.

### Making a Pull Request
Please adhere to these guidelines when submitting a pull request:
- **Check for Duplicates**: Ensure your contribution is unique and not already included.
- **Submit Separate Pull Requests**: Submit individual pull requests for each suggestion or dataset.
- **Follow the format**: Use our JSON template for datasets and maintain readability and structure in documentation.
